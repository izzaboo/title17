(A)  A stock dividend or equivalent equity distribution, whether the
corporation or other business organization distributing the dividend or
equivalent equity distribution is the issuer or not, if nothing of value
is given by stockholders or other equity holders for the dividend or
equivalent equity distribution other than the surrender of a right to a
cash or property dividend if each stockholder or other equity holder may
elect to take the dividend or equivalent equity distribution in cash,
property, or stock;

following requirements:

(i)  The issuer of the security is an entity that is incorporated or
organized under the laws of this state and is authorized to do business
in this state;

(ii)  The transaction meets the requirements for the federal exemption
for intrastate offerings under section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act of
1933, (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(11)), and securities and exchange commission
rule 147, (17 C.F.R. 230.147), including, but not limited to, the

resells that security within nine (9) months after the closing of the
particular offering in which the purchaser obtained that security to a
person that is not a resident of this state, the original investment
agreement between the issuer and the purchaser is void. If an agreement
to purchase, or the purchase of, a security is void under this
subparagraph, the issuer may recover damages from the misrepresenting
offeree or purchaser. These damages include, but are not limited to, the
issuer's expenses in resolving the misrepresentation. However, damages
described in this subparagraph shall not exceed the amount of the
person's investment in the security.

(iii)  The sum of all cash and other consideration to be received for
all sales of the security in reliance on this exemption does not exceed
the following amounts:

received for all sales of securities by the issuer within the twelve
(12) months before the first offer or sale made in reliance on this
exemption, if the issuer has not made available to each prospective
purchaser and the secretary of state audited financial statements or
reviewed financial statements for the issuer's most recently completed
fiscal year, prepared by a certified public accountant, holding a
certificate pursuant to W.S. 33‑3‑109, in accordance with the statements
on auditing standards of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants or the statements on standards for accounting and review

purchaser and the secretary of state audited financial statements or
reviewed financial statements for the issuer's most recently completed
fiscal year, prepared by a certified public accountant, holding a
certificate pursuant to W.S. 33‑3‑109, in accordance with the statements

accredited investor as defined by rule 501 of securities and exchange
commission regulation D, (17 C.F.R. 230.501). The issuer may rely on
confirmation that the purchaser is an accredited investor from a
licensed broker‑dealer or another third party in making a determination
that the purchaser is an accredited investor;

(v)  At least ten (10) days before an offer of securities is made in
reliance on this exemption or the use of any publicly available website

or other person occupying a similar status or performing similar
functions on behalf of the issuer;

(II)  The identity of each person that owns more than ten percent (10%)
of the ownership interests of any class of securities of the issuer;

to assist the issuer in conducting the offering and sale of the
securities, including the owner of any websites, if known, but excluding
any person acting solely as an accountant or attorney and any employees

contract with the issuer to collect reasonable fees for its escrow
services regardless of whether the target offering amount is reached.

(vi)  The issuer is not, either before or as a result of the offering,
an investment company, as defined in section 3 of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, (15 U.S.C. § 80a‑3), or an entity that would be an

securities are subject to limitations on transfer or resale and displays
the following legend conspicuously on the cover page of the disclosure
statement:

"IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION, PURCHASERS MUST RELY ON THEIR OWN
EXAMINATION OF THE ISSUER AND THE TERMS OF THE OFFERING, INCLUDING THE
MERITS AND RISKS INVOLVED. THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN RECOMMENDED BY
ANY FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY.
FURTHERMORE, THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY
OR DETERMINED THE ADEQUACY OF THIS DOCUMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE
CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR
RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED BY SUBSECTION (E) OF SEC RULE 147, (17 C.F.R.
230.147(E)), AS PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, AND THE APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO

AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME.".

(viii)  The issuer requires each purchaser to certify in writing, and to
include as part of that certification his signature, and his initials
next to each paragraph of the certification, as follows:

"I understand and acknowledge that:

I am investing in a high‑risk, speculative business venture. I may lose
all of my investment, and I can afford the loss of my investment. This
offering has not been reviewed or approved by any state or federal
securities commission or other regulatory authority and that no
regulatory authority has confirmed the accuracy or determined the
adequacy of any disclosure made to me relating to this offering.

The securities I am acquiring in this offering are illiquid, that the
securities are subject to possible dilution, that there is no ready
market for the sale of those securities, that it may be difficult or
impossible for me to sell or otherwise dispose of this investment, and
that, accordingly, I may be required to hold this investment
indefinitely.

I may be subject to tax on my share of the taxable income and losses of
the issuer, whether or not I have sold or otherwise disposed of my
investment or received any dividends or other distributions from the
issuer.

By entering into this transaction with the issuer, I am affirmatively
representing myself as being a Wyoming resident at the time that this
contract is formed, and if this representation is subsequently shown to
be false, the contract is void.

If I resell any of the securities I am acquiring in this offering to a
person that is not a Wyoming resident, within nine (9) months after the
closing of the offering, my contract with the issuer for the purchase of
these securities is void.".

(ix)  If the offer and sale of securities under this section is made
through an internet website, all of the following requirements must be
met:

(A)  Before any offer of an investment opportunity to residents of this
state through the use of a website, the issuer provides to the website
and to the secretary of state evidence that the issuer is organized
under the laws of this state and that it is authorized to do business in
this state;

(B)  The issuer obtains from each purchaser of a security under this
section evidence that the purchaser is a resident of this state and, if
applicable, an accredited investor;

(C)  The website operator files a written notice with the secretary of
state that includes the website operator's name, business address, and
contact information and states that it is authorized to do business in
this state and is being utilized to offer and sell securities under this
exemption. Beginning twelve (12) months after the date of the written
notice, a website operator that has filed a written notice under this
subparagraph shall annually notify the secretary of state in writing of
any changes in the information provided to the secretary of state under
this subparagraph and shall pay a renewal fee;

(D)  The issuer and the website keep and maintain records of the offers
and sales of securities made through the website and provide ready
access to the records to the secretary of state on request. The
secretary of state may access, inspect, and review any website described

(x)  All payments for the purchase of securities are directed to and
held by the bank or depository institution subject to the provisions of
subparagraph (v)(C) of this subsection;

(xi)  Offers or sales of a security are not made through an internet
website unless the website has filed the written notice required under
subparagraph (ix)(C) of this subsection with the secretary of state;

(xii)  The issuer does not pay, directly or indirectly, any commission
or remuneration to an executive officer, director, managing member, or
other individual who has a similar status or performs similar functions
in the name of and on behalf of the issuer for offering or selling the
securities unless he or she is registered as a broker‑dealer, investment
adviser, or investment adviser representative under article 4 of this
act. An executive officer, director, managing member, or other
individual who has a similar status or performs similar functions in the
name of and on behalf of the issuer is exempt from the registration
requirements under article 4 of this act if he or she does not receive,
directly or indirectly, any commission or remuneration for offering or
selling securities of the issuer that are exempt from registration under
this section;

(xiii)  The issuer provides a copy of the disclosure statement provided
to the secretary of state under subparagraph (v)(B) of this subsection
to each prospective purchaser at the time the offer of securities is
made to the prospective purchaser. In addition to the information
described in subparagraph (v)(B) of this subsection, the disclosure
statement provided to the secretary of state and to prospective
purchasers shall include additional information material to the
offering, including, where appropriate, a discussion of significant
factors that make the offering speculative or risky. This discussion
must be concise and organized logically and should not present risks
that could apply to any issuer or any offering;

(xiv)  The term of the offering does not exceed twelve (12) months after
the date of the first offer.

(b)  If the offer and sale of a security of an issuer is exempt under
this section, the issuer shall provide a quarterly report to the
issuer's purchasers until none of the securities issued under this
section are outstanding. All of the following apply to the quarterly
report described in this subsection:

(i)  The issuer shall provide the report free of charge to the
purchasers;

the issuer, including cash compensation earned since the previous report
and on an annual basis and any bonuses, stock options, other rights to
receive securities of the issuer or any affiliate of the issuer, or
other compensation received;

(B)  An analysis by management of the issuer of the business operations
and financial condition of the issuer.

(c)  The exemption provided in this section shall not be used in
conjunction with any other exemption under this article, except offers
and sales to controlling persons shall not count toward the limitation
in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section.

(d)  The exemption described in this section does not apply if an issuer
or person that is affiliated with the issuer or offering is subject to
any disqualification established by the secretary of state by rule or
contained in rule 262 as promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
(17 C.F.R. 230.262). However, this subsection does not apply if both of
the following are met:

(i)  On a showing of good cause and without prejudice to any other
action by the secretary of state, the secretary of state determines that
it is not necessary under the circumstances that an exemption be denied;
and

(ii)  The issuer establishes that it made factual inquiry into whether
any disqualification existed under this subsection but did not know, and
in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, that a
disqualification existed under this subsection. The nature and scope of
the requisite inquiry will vary based on the circumstances of the issuer
and the other offering participants.

(e)  The secretary of state may adopt rules to implement the provisions
of this section and to protect purchasers that purchase securities that
are exempt from registration under this section.

(f)  The secretary of state shall charge a nonrefundable filing fee for

dollar (\$100.00) renewal fee.

(g)  A website through which an offer or sale of securities under this
section is made is not subject to the broker‑dealer, investment adviser,
or investment adviser representative registration requirements under
article 4 of this act if the website meets all of the following

(ii)  It does not solicit purchases, sales, or offers to buy the

(iv)  It does not hold, manage, possess, or otherwise handle purchaser
funds or securities;

(v)  It does not engage in any other activities that the secretary of
state by rule determines are inappropriate for an exemption from the

violation of this section, including a violation concerning website
operation.

(j)  As used in this section, "controlling person" means an officer,
director, partner, or trustee, or another individual who has similar
status or performs similar functions, of or for the issuer or to a
person that owns ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding shares of
any class or classes of securities of the issuer.

act may waive, in whole or in part, any or all of the conditions for an
exemption or offer under W.S. 17‑4‑201 through 17‑4‑203.

17‑4‑205.  Denial, suspension, revocation, condition, or limitation of
exemptions.

(a)  Except with respect to a federal covered security or a transaction
involving a federal covered security, an order under this act may deny,

under W.S. 17‑4‑201(a)(iii)(C), (vii) or (viii), or 17‑4‑202 and
17‑4‑203, or an exemption or waiver created under W.S. 17‑4‑204 with
respect to a specific security, transaction, or offer. An order under

filing by filing a copy of those records filed by the issuer with the
securities and exchange commission that are required by rule or order
under this act to be filed and by paying a renewal fee as set by rule. A

17‑4‑611 may be incorporated by reference in a renewal. A renewed notice
filing becomes effective upon the expiration of the filing being
renewed.

(c)  With respect to a security that is a federal covered security under
section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. §
77r(b)(4)(D)), a rule under this act may require a notice filing by or

(d)  Except with respect to a federal security under section 18(b)(1) of

state finds that there is a failure to comply with a notice or fee
requirement of this section, the secretary of state may issue a stop
order suspending the offer and sale of a federal covered security in

when all the following conditions are satisfied:

(i)  A stop order under subsection (d) of this section or W.S. 17‑4‑306
or issued by the securities and exchange commission is not in effect and
a proceeding is not pending against the issuer under W.S. 17‑4‑306; and

(ii)  The registration statement has been on file for at least twenty
(20) days or a shorter period provided by rule adopted or order issued
under this act.

(d)  The registrant shall promptly notify the secretary of state in a
record of the date when the federal registration statement becomes
effective and the content of any price amendment and shall promptly file
a record containing the price amendment. If the notice is not timely
received, the secretary of state may issue a stop order, without prior
notice or hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to the
registration statement or suspending its effectiveness until compliance

waived. If the registrant notifies the secretary of state of the date
when the federal registration statement is expected to become effective,
the secretary of state shall promptly notify the registrant by telegram,
telephone, or electronic means and promptly confirm this notice by a
record, indicating whether all the conditions are satisfied or waived
and whether the secretary of state intends the institution of a
proceeding under W.S. 17‑4‑306. The notice by the secretary of state

under this act.

(b)  A person filing a registration statement shall pay a filing fee of
one‑fiftieth of one percent (.0002) of the total dollar offering amount
to be offered in this state, but the fee shall in no case be less than
two hundred dollars (\$200.00) nor more than six hundred dollars
(\$600.00) when filing an initial registration statement or renewing a
previously filed registration statement. If a registration statement is
withdrawn before the effective date or a preeffective stop order is
issued under W.S. 17‑4‑306 the secretary of state shall retain one
hundred dollars (\$100.00) of the fee.

(c)  A registration statement filed under W.S. 17‑4‑303 or 17‑4‑304 must
specify:

(i)  The amount of securities to be offered in this state;

incorporated by reference in the registration statement to the extent
that the record is currently accurate.

(e)  In the case of a nonissuer distribution, information or a record
may not be required under subsection (j) of this section or W.S.
17‑4‑304, unless it is known to the person filing the registration
statement or to the person on whose behalf the distribution is to be
made or unless it can be furnished by those persons without unreasonable
effort or expense.

(f)  A rule adopted or order issued under this act may require as a
condition of registration that a security issued within the previous
five (5) years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration
substantially less than the public offering price or to a person for a
consideration other than cash be deposited in escrow; and that the
proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this state be
impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of
the security either in this state or elsewhere. The conditions of any
escrow or impoundment required under this subsection may be established

state may not reject a depository institution solely because of its
location in another state.

(g)  A rule adopted or order issued under this act may require as a

nonexempted transaction by or for the account of the issuer or other
person on whose behalf the offering is being made or by an underwriter
or broker‑dealer that is still offering part of an unsold allotment or
subscription taken as a participant in the distribution. For the
purposes of a nonissuer transaction, all outstanding securities of the
same class identified in the registration statement as a security
registered under this act are considered to be registered while the
registration statement is effective. If any securities of the same class
are outstanding, a registration statement may not be withdrawn until one
(1) year after its effective date. A registration statement may be
withdrawn only with the approval of the secretary of state.

(j)  While a registration statement is effective, a rule adopted or
order issued under this act may require the person that filed the
registration statement to file reports, not more often than quarterly,
to keep the information or other record in the registration statement
reasonably current and to disclose the progress of the offering.

(k)  A registration statement may be amended after its effective date.
The post effective amendment becomes effective when the secretary of
state so orders. If a post effective amendment is made to increase the
number of securities specified to be offered or sold, the person filing
the amendment shall pay a registration fee specified in subsection (b)
of this section. A post effective amendment relates back to the date of

(a)  The secretary of state may issue a stop order denying effectiveness
to, or suspending or revoking the effectiveness of, a registration
statement if the secretary of state finds that the order is in the
public interest and that:

(i)  The registration statement as of its effective date or before the
effective date in the case of an order denying effectiveness, an
amendment under W.S. 17‑4‑305(k) as of its effective date, or a report

a statement that, in the light of the circumstances under which it was
made, was false or misleading with respect to a material fact;

(ii)  This act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act or a
condition imposed under this act has been willfully violated, in
connection with the offering, by the person filing the registration
statement; by the issuer, a partner, officer, or director of the issuer
or a person having a similar status or performing a similar function; a
promoter of the issuer; or a person directly or indirectly controlling
or controlled by the issuer; but only if the person filing the
registration statement is directly or indirectly controlled by or acting
for the issuer; or by an underwriter;

(iii)  The security registered or sought to be registered is the subject
of a permanent or temporary injunction of a court of competent
jurisdiction or an administrative stop order or similar order issued
under any federal, foreign, or state law other than this act applicable
to the offering, but the secretary of state may not institute a
proceeding against an effective registration statement under this
paragraph more than one (1) year after the date of the order or
injunction on which it is based, and the secretary of state may not
issue an order under this paragraph on the basis of an order or
injunction issued under the securities act of another state unless the
order or injunction was based on conduct that would constitute, as of
the date of the order, a ground for a stop order under this section;

(iv)  The issuer's enterprise or method of business includes or would
include activities that are unlawful where performed;

(v)  With respect to a security sought to be registered under W.S.
17‑4‑303, there has been a failure to comply with the undertaking
required by W.S. 17‑4‑303(b)(iv);

(vi)  The applicant or registrant has not paid the filing fee, but the
secretary of state shall void the order if the deficiency is corrected;
or

(vii)  The offering:

(A)  Will work or tend to work a fraud upon purchasers or would so
operate;

(B)  Has been or would be made with unreasonable amounts of
underwriters' and sellers' discounts, commissions, or other
compensation, or promoters' profits or participations, or unreasonable
amounts or kinds of options; or

(C)  Is being made on terms that are unfair, unjust, or inequitable.

(b)  To the extent practicable, the secretary of state by rule adopted
or order issued under this act shall publish standards that provide
notice of conduct that violates paragraph (a)(vii) of this section.

(c)  The secretary of state may not institute a stop order proceeding
against an effective registration statement on the basis of conduct or a
transaction known to the secretary of state when the registration
statement became effective unless the proceeding is instituted within
thirty (30) days after the registration statement became effective.

(d)  The secretary of state may summarily revoke, deny, postpone, or
suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement pending final
determination of an administrative proceeding. Upon the issuance of the
order, the secretary of state shall promptly notify each person
specified in subsection (e) of this section that the order has been
issued, the reasons for the revocation, denial, postponement, or
suspension, and that within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of a
request in a record from the person the matter will be scheduled for a
hearing. If a hearing is not requested and none is ordered by the
secretary of state, within thirty (30) days after the date of service of
the order, the order becomes final. If a hearing is requested or
ordered, the secretary of state, after notice of and opportunity for
hearing for each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the
order or extend the order until final determination.

offered;

(ii)  An opportunity for hearing; and

(iii)  Findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record in accordance
with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.

(f)  The secretary of state may modify or vacate a stop order issued
under this section if the secretary of state finds that the conditions
that caused its issuance have changed or that it is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

17‑4‑307.  Waiver and modification.

The secretary of state may waive or modify, in whole or in part, any or
all of the requirements of W.S. 17‑4‑302, 17‑4‑303, and 17‑4‑304(b) or

subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section based solely on material

necessary to make the statement made, in the light of the circumstances
under which it was made, not false or misleading.

17‑4‑506.  Misrepresentations concerning registration or exemption.

(a)  The filing of an application for registration, a registration
statement, a notice filing under this act, the registration of a person,
the notice filing by a person, or the registration of a security under
this act does not constitute a finding by the secretary of state that a
record filed under this act is true, complete, and not misleading. The
filing or registration or the availability of an exemption, exception,
preemption, or exclusion for a security or a transaction does not mean
that the secretary of state has passed upon the merits or qualifications
of, or recommended or given approval to, a person, security, or
transaction.

(b)  It is unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to a purchaser,
customer, client, or prospective customer or client a representation
inconsistent with this section.

17‑4‑507.  Qualified immunity.

A broker‑dealer, agent, investment adviser, federal covered investment
adviser, or investment adviser representative is not liable to another
broker‑dealer, agent, investment adviser, federal covered investment
adviser, or investment adviser representative for defamation relating to
a statement that is contained in a record required by the secretary of
state, or designee of the secretary of state, the securities and
exchange commission, or a self‑regulatory organization, unless the
person knew, or should have known at the time that the statement was
made, that it was false in a material respect or the person acted in
reckless disregard of the statement's truth or falsity.

17‑4‑508.  Criminal penalties.

(a)  A person that willfully violates this act, or a rule adopted or
order issued under this act, except W.S. 17‑4‑504 or the notice filing
requirements of W.S. 17‑4‑302 or 17‑4‑405, or that willfully violates
W.S. 17‑4‑505 knowing the statement made to be false or misleading in a
material respect, upon conviction, shall be fined not more than five
thousand dollars (\$5,000.00) or imprisoned not more than three (3)
years, or both. An individual convicted of violating a rule or order
under this act may be fined, but may not be imprisoned, if the
individual did not have knowledge of the rule or order.

(b)  The attorney general or district attorney with or without a
reference from the secretary of state, may institute criminal
proceedings under this act.

(c)  This act does not limit the power of this state to punish a person
for conduct that constitutes a crime under other laws of this state.

17‑4‑509.  Civil Liability.

(a)  Enforcement of civil liability under this section is subject to the
Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998.

(b)  A person is liable to the purchaser if the person sells a security
in violation of W.S. 17‑4‑301 or, by means of an untrue statement of a
material fact or an omission to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it
is made, not misleading, the purchaser not knowing the untruth or
omission and the seller not sustaining the burden of proof that the
seller did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not
have known of the untruth or omission. An action under this subsection
is governed by the following:

(i)  The purchaser may maintain an action to recover the consideration
paid for the security, less the amount of any income received on the
security, and interest at six percent (6%) per year from the date of the
purchase, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court,
upon the tender of the security, or for actual damages as provided in
paragraph (iii) of this subsection;

(ii)  The tender referred to in paragraph (i) of this subsection may be
made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a
record of ownership of the security and willingness to exchange the
security for the amount specified. A purchaser that no longer owns the
security may recover actual damages as provided in paragraph (iii) of
this subsection;

(iii)  Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the
amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less the value of the
security when the purchaser disposed of it, and interest at six percent
(6%) per year from the date of the purchase, costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees determined by the court.

(c)  A person is liable to the seller if the person buys a security by
means of an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of
the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the seller not
knowing of the untruth or omission, and the purchaser not sustaining the
burden of proof that the purchaser did not know, and in the exercise of
reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission. An
action under this subsection is governed by the following:

(i)  The seller may maintain an action to recover the security, and any
income received on the security, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees
determined by the court, upon the tender of the purchase price, or for
actual damages as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection;

(ii)  The tender referred to in paragraph (i) of this subsection may be
made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a
record of the present ability to pay the amount tendered and willingness
to take delivery of the security for the amount specified. If the
purchaser no longer owns the security, the seller may recover actual
damages as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection;

(iii)  Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the
difference between the price at which the security was sold and the
value the security would have had at the time of the sale in the absence
of the purchaser's conduct causing liability, and interest at six
percent (6%) per year from the date of the sale of the security, costs,
and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.

(d)  A person acting as a broker‑dealer or agent that sells or buys a
security in violation of W.S. 17‑4‑401(a), 17‑4‑402(a), or 17‑4‑506 is
liable to the customer. The customer, if a purchaser, may maintain an
action for recovery of actual damages as specified in paragraphs (b)(i)
through (iii) of this section, or, if a seller, for a remedy as
specified in paragraphs (c)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(e)  A person acting as an investment adviser or investment adviser
representative that provides investment advice for compensation in
violation of W.S. 17‑4‑403(a), 17‑4‑404(a), or 17‑4‑506 is liable to the
client. The client may maintain an action to recover the consideration
paid for the advice, interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per year
from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees
determined by the court.

(f)  A person that receives directly or indirectly any consideration for
providing investment advice to another person and that employs a device,
scheme, or artifice to defraud the other person or engages in an act,
practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a
fraud or deceit on the other person, is liable to the other person. An
action under this subsection is governed by the following:

(i)  The person defrauded may maintain an action to recover the
consideration paid for the advice and the amount of any actual damages
caused by the fraudulent conduct, interest at six percent (6%) per year
from the date of the fraudulent conduct, costs, and reasonable
attorneys' fees determined by the court, less the amount of any income
received as a result of the fraudulent conduct;

(ii)  This subsection does not apply to a broker‑dealer or its agents if
the investment advice provided is solely incidental to transacting
business as a broker‑dealer and no special compensation is received for
the investment advice.

(g)  The following persons are liable jointly and severally with and to
the same extent as persons liable under subsections (b) through (f) of
this section:

(i)  A person that directly or indirectly controls a person liable under
subsections (b) through (f) of this section, unless the controlling
person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know, and in
the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence
of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist;

(ii)  An individual who is a managing partner, executive officer, or
director of a person liable under subsections (b) through (f) of this
section, including an individual having a similar status or performing
similar functions, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof
that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care
could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the
liability is alleged to exist;

(iii)  An individual who is an employee of or associated with a person
liable under subsections (b) through (f) of this section and who
materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability, unless the
individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know
and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the
existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to
exist; and

(iv)  A person that is a broker‑dealer, agent, investment adviser, or
investment adviser representative that materially aids the conduct
giving rise to the liability under subsections (b) through (f) of this
section, unless the person sustains the burden of proof that the person
did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have
known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which liability is
alleged to exist.

(h)  A person liable under this section has a right of contribution as
in cases of contract against any other person liable under this section
for the same conduct.

(j)  A cause of action under this section survives the death of an
individual who might have been a plaintiff or defendant.

(k)  A person may not obtain relief:

(i)  Under subsection (b) of this section for violation of W.S.
17‑4‑301, or under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, unless the
action is instituted within one (1) year after the violation occurred;
or

(ii)  Under subsection (b) of this section, other than for violation of
W.S. 17‑4‑301, or under subsection (c) or (f) of this section, unless
the action is instituted within the earlier of two (2) years after
discovery of the facts constituting the violation or five (5) years
after the violation.

(m)  A person that has made, or has engaged in the performance of, a
contract in violation of this act or a rule adopted or order issued
under this act, or that has acquired a purported right under the
contract with knowledge of conduct by reason of which its making or
performance was in violation of this act, may not base an action on the
contract.

(n)  A condition, stipulation, or provision binding a person purchasing
or selling a security or receiving investment advice to waive compliance
with this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act is void.

(o)  The rights and remedies provided by this act are in addition to any
other rights or remedies that may exist, but this act does not create a
cause of action not specified in this section or W.S. 17‑4‑411(e).

17‑4‑510.  Rescission offers.

(a)  A purchaser, seller, or recipient of investment advice may not
maintain an action under W.S. 17‑4‑509 if:

in a record, before the action is instituted:

(A)  An offer stating the respect in which liability under W.S. 17‑4‑509
may have arisen and fairly advising the purchaser, seller, or recipient
of investment advice of that person's rights in connection with the
offer, and any financial or other information necessary to correct all
material misrepresentations or omissions in the information that was
required by this act to be furnished to that person at the time of the
purchase, sale, or investment advice;

(B)  If the basis for relief under this section may have been a

paid, and interest at six percent (6%) per year from the date of the
purchase, less the amount of any income received on the security, or, if
the purchaser no longer owns the security, an offer to pay the purchaser
upon acceptance of the offer damages in an amount that would be

purchaser disposed of it, and interest at six percent (6%) per year from
the date of the purchase in cash equal to the damages computed in the
manner provided in this subsection;

(C)  If the basis for relief under this section may have been a
violation of W.S. 17‑4‑509(c), an offer to tender the security, on
payment by the seller of an amount equal to the purchase price paid,
less income received on the security by the purchaser and interest at
six percent (6%) per year from the date of the sale; or if the purchaser
no longer owns the security, an offer to pay the seller upon acceptance
of the offer, in cash, damages in the amount of the difference between
the price at which the security was purchased and the value the security
would have had at the time of the purchase in the absence of the
purchaser's conduct that may have caused liability and interest at six
percent (6%) per year from the date of the sale;

ADMINISTRATION AND JUDICIAL REVIEW

17‑4‑601.  Administration.

(a)  The secretary of state shall administer this act.

(b)  It is unlawful for the secretary of state or an officer, employee,
or designee of the secretary of state to use for personal benefit or the
benefit of others records or other information obtained by or filed with
the secretary of state that are not public under W.S. 17‑4‑607(b). This
act does not authorize the secretary of state or an officer, employee,
or designee of the secretary of state to disclose the record or
information, except in accordance with W.S. 17‑4‑602, 17‑4‑607(c), or
17‑4‑608.

(c)  This act does not create or diminish a privilege or exemption that
exists at common law, by statute or rule, or otherwise.

(d)  The secretary of state may develop and implement investor education
initiatives to inform the public about investing in securities, with
particular emphasis on the prevention and detection of securities fraud.
In developing and implementing these initiatives, the secretary of state
may collaborate with public and nonprofit organizations with an interest
in investor education. The secretary of state may accept a grant or
donation from a person that is not affiliated with the securities
industry or from a nonprofit organization, regardless of whether the
organization is affiliated with the securities industry, to develop and
implement investor education initiatives. This subsection does not
authorize the secretary of state to require participation or monetary
contributions of a registrant in an investor education program.

17‑4‑602.  Investigations and subpoenas.

(a)  The secretary of state may:

(i)  Conduct public or private investigations within or outside of this
state which the secretary of state considers necessary or appropriate to
determine whether a person has violated, is violating, or is about to
violate this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act, or to
aid in the enforcement of this act or in the adoption of rules and forms
under this act;

(ii)  Require or permit a person to testify, file a statement, or
produce a record, under oath or otherwise as the secretary of state
determines, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning a matter to
be investigated or about which an action or proceeding is to be
instituted; and

(iii)  Publish a record concerning an action, proceeding, or an
investigation under, or a violation of, this act or a rule adopted or
order issued under this act if the secretary of state determines it is
necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection
of investors.

(b)  For the purpose of an investigation under this act, the secretary
of state or his designated officer may administer oaths and
affirmations, subpoena witnesses, seek compulsion of attendance, take
evidence, require the filing of statements, and require the production
of any records that the secretary of state considers relevant or
material to the investigation.

(c)  If a person does not appear or refuses to testify, file a
statement, produce records, or otherwise does not obey a subpoena as
required by the secretary of state under this act, the secretary of
state may refer the matter to the attorney general or district attorney,
who may apply to the Wyoming district court or a court of another state
to enforce compliance. The court may:

(i)  Hold the person in contempt;

(ii)  Order the person to appear before the secretary of state;

(iii)  Order the person to testify about the matter under investigation
or in question;

(iv)  Order the production of records;

(v)  Grant injunctive relief, including restricting or prohibiting the
offer or sale of securities or the providing of investment advice;

(vi)  Impose a civil penalty of not less than five thousand dollars
(\$5,000.00) and not greater than fifty thousand (\$50,000.00) for each
violation; and

(vii)  Grant any other necessary or appropriate relief.

(d)  This section does not preclude a person from applying to Wyoming
district court or a court of another state for relief from a request to
appear, testify, file a statement, produce records, or obey a subpoena.

(e)  An individual is not excused from attending, testifying, filing a
statement, producing a record or other evidence, or obeying a subpoena
of the secretary of state under this act or in an action or proceeding
instituted by the secretary of state under this act on the ground that
the required testimony, statement, record, or other evidence, directly
or indirectly, may tend to incriminate the individual or subject the
individual to a criminal fine, penalty, or forfeiture. If the individual
refuses to testify, file a statement, or produce a record or other
evidence on the basis of the individual's privilege against
self‑incrimination, the secretary of state may apply to the Wyoming
district court to compel the testimony, the filing of the statement, the
production of the record, or the giving of other evidence. The
testimony, record, or other evidence compelled under such an order may
not be used, directly or indirectly, against the individual in a
criminal case, except in a prosecution for perjury or contempt or
otherwise failing to comply with the order.

(f)  At the request of the securities regulator of another state or a
foreign jurisdiction, the secretary of state may provide assistance if
the requesting regulator states that it is conducting an investigation
to determine whether a person has violated, is violating, or is about to
violate a law or rule of the other state or foreign jurisdiction
relating to securities matters that the requesting regulator administers
or enforces. The secretary of state may provide the assistance by using
the authority to investigate and the powers conferred by this section as
the secretary of state determines is necessary or appropriate. The
assistance may be provided without regard to whether the conduct
described in the request would also constitute a violation of this act
or other law of this state if occurring in this state. In deciding
whether to provide the assistance, the secretary of state may consider
whether the requesting regulator is permitted and has agreed to provide
assistance reciprocally within its state or foreign jurisdiction to the
secretary of state on securities matters when requested; whether
compliance with the request would violate or prejudice the public policy
of this state; and the availability of resources and employees of the
secretary of state to carry out the request for assistance.

17‑4‑603.  Civil enforcement.

(a)  If the secretary of state believes that a person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of
business constituting a violation of this act or a rule adopted or order
issued under this act or that a person has, is, or is about to engage in
an act, practice, or course of business that materially aids a violation
of this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act, the
secretary of state may maintain an action in the Wyoming district court
to enjoin the act, practice, or course of business and to enforce
compliance with this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this
act.

(b)  In an action under this section and on a proper showing, the court
may:

(i)  Issue a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or
declaratory judgment;

(ii)  Order other appropriate or ancillary relief, which may include:

(A)  An asset freeze, accounting, writ of attachment, writ of general or
specific execution, and appointment of a receiver or conservator, that
may be the secretary of state, for the defendant or the defendant's
assets;

(B)  Ordering the secretary of state to take charge and control of a
defendant's property, including investment accounts and accounts in a
depository institution, rents, and profits; to collect debts; and to
acquire and dispose of property;

(C)  Imposing a civil penalty up to five thousand dollars (\$5,000.00)
for a single violation or up to fifty thousand dollars (\$50,000.00) for
more than one (1) violation; an order of rescission, restitution, or
disgorgement directed to a person that has engaged in an act, practice,
or course of business constituting a violation of this act or the
predecessor act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act or the
predecessor act; and

(D)  Ordering the payment of prejudgment and post judgment interest.

(iii)  Order such other relief as the court considers appropriate.

(c)  The secretary of state may not be required to post a bond in an
action or proceeding under this act.

17‑4‑604.  Administrative enforcement.

(a)  If the secretary of state determines that a person has engaged, is
engaging or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of
business constituting a violation of this act or a rule adopted or order
issued under this act or that a person has materially aided, is
materially aiding, or is about to materially aid an act, practice, or
course of business constituting a violation of this act or a rule
adopted or order issued under this act, the secretary of state may:

(i)  Issue an order directing the person to cease and desist from
engaging in the act, practice, or course of business or to take other
action necessary or appropriate to comply with this act;

(ii)  Issue an order denying, suspending, revoking, or conditioning the
exemptions for a broker‑dealer under W.S. 17‑4‑401(b)(i)(D) or (F) or an
investment adviser under W.S. 17‑4‑403(b)(i)(C); or

(iii)  Issue an order under W.S. 17‑4‑205.

(b)  An order under subsection (a) of this section is effective on the
date of issuance. Upon issuance of the order, the secretary of state
shall promptly serve each person subject to the order with a copy of the
order and a notice that the order has been entered. The order must
include a statement whether the secretary of state will seek a civil
penalty or costs of the investigation, a statement of the reasons for
the order, and notice that, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a
request in a record from the person, the matter will be scheduled for a
hearing. If a person subject to the order does not request a hearing and
none is ordered by the secretary of state within thirty (30) days after
the date of service of the order, the order, which may include a civil
penalty or costs of the investigation if a civil penalty or costs were
sought in the statement accompanying the order, becomes final as to that
person by operation of law. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the
secretary of state, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each
person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend it
until final determination.

(c)  If a hearing is requested or ordered pursuant to subsection (b) of
this section, a hearing must be held pursuant to the Wyoming
Administrative Procedure Act. A final order may not be issued unless the
secretary of state makes findings of fact and conclusions of law in a
record in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The
final order may make final, vacate, or modify the order issued under
subsection (a) of this section.

(d)  In a final order under subsection (c) of this section, the
secretary of state may impose a civil penalty up to five thousand
dollars (\$5,000.00) for a single violation or up to fifty thousand
dollars (\$50,000.00) for more than one (1) violation.

(e)  In a final order, the secretary of state may charge the actual cost
of an investigation or proceeding for a violation of this act or a rule
adopted or order issued under this act.

(f)  If a petition for judicial review of a final order is not filed in
accordance with W.S. 17‑4‑609, the secretary of state may file a
certified copy of the final order with the clerk of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The order so filed has the same effect as a judgment of
the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner
as a judgment of the court.

(g)  If a person does not comply with an order under this section, the
secretary of state may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce the order. The court may not require the secretary of state to
post a bond in an action or proceeding under this section. If the court
finds, after service and opportunity for hearing, that the person was
not in compliance with the order, the court may adjudge the person in
civil contempt of the order. The court may impose a further civil
penalty against the person for contempt in an amount not less than five
thousand dollars (\$5,000.00) but not greater than fifty thousand
dollars (\$50,000.00) for each violation and may grant any other relief
the court determines is just and proper in the circumstances.

17‑4‑605.  Rules, forms, orders, interpretative opinions, and hearings.

(a)  The secretary of state may:

(i)  Issue forms and orders and, after notice and comment, may adopt and
amend rules necessary or appropriate to carry out this act and may
repeal rules, including rules and forms governing registration
statements, applications, notice filings, reports, and other records;

(ii)  By rule, define terms, whether or not used in this act, but those
definitions may not be inconsistent with this act; and

(iii)  By rule, classify securities, persons, and transactions and adopt
different requirements for different classes.

(b)  Under this act, a rule or form may not be adopted or amended, or an
order issued or amended, unless the secretary of state finds that the
rule, form, order, or amendment is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors and is consistent
with the purposes intended by this act. In adopting, amending, and
repealing rules and forms, W.S. 17‑4‑608 applies in order to achieve
uniformity among the states and coordination with federal laws in the
form and content of registration statements, applications, reports, and
other records, including the adoption of uniform rules, forms, and
procedures.

(c)  Subject to section 15(h) of the Securities Exchange Act and section
222 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the secretary of state may
require that a financial statement filed under this act be prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States and comply with other requirements specified by rule adopted or
order issued under this act. A rule adopted or order issued under this
act may establish:

(i)  Subject to section 15(h) of the Securities Exchange Act and section
222 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the form and content of
financial statements required under this act;

(ii)  Whether unconsolidated financial statements must be filed; and

(iii)  Whether required financial statements must be audited by an
independent certified public accountant.

(d)  The secretary of state may provide interpretative opinions or issue
determinations that the secretary of state will not institute a
proceeding or an action under this act against a specified person for
engaging in a specified act, practice, or course of business if the
determination is consistent with this act. A rule adopted or order
issued under this act may establish a reasonable charge for
interpretative opinions or determinations that the secretary of state
will not institute an action or a proceeding under this act.

(e)  A penalty under this act may not be imposed for, and liability does
not arise from conduct that is engaged in or omitted in good faith
believing it conforms to a rule, form, or order of the secretary of
state under this act.

(f)  A hearing in an administrative proceeding under this act must be
conducted in public unless the secretary of state for good cause
consistent with this act determines that the hearing will not be so
conducted.

17‑4‑606.  Administrative files and opinions.

(a)  The secretary of state shall maintain, or designate a person to
maintain, a register of applications for registration of securities;
registration statements; notice filings; applications for registration
of broker‑dealers, agents, investment advisers, and investment adviser
representatives; notice filings by federal covered investment advisers
that are or have been effective under this act or the predecessor act;

opinions, and orders available to the public.

Wyoming Public Records Act, W.S. 16‑4‑201 through 16‑4‑205.

17‑4‑607.  Public records; confidentiality.

(a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section,
records obtained by the secretary of state or filed under this act,

purchase is made in this state or the offer to sell or the sale is made
and accepted in this state.

(c)  For the purpose of this section, an offer to sell or to purchase a
security is made in this state, whether or not either party is then
present in this state, if the offer:

(i)  Originates from within this state; or

(ii)  Is directed by the offeror to a place in this state and received
at the place to which it is directed.

(d)  For the purpose of this section, an offer to purchase or to sell is
accepted in this state, whether or not either party is then present in
this state, if the acceptance:

(i)  Is communicated to the offeror in this state and the offeree
reasonably believes the offeror to be present in this state and the

regular, and paid circulation that is not published in this state, or
that is published in this state but has had more than two‑thirds (2/3)
of its circulation outside this state during the previous twelve (12)
months or when a radio or television program or other electronic
communication originating outside this state is received in this state.
A radio or television program, or other electronic communication is

state, unless:

(i)  The program or communication is syndicated and distributed from

course of business instrumental in effecting prohibited or actionable
conduct in this state, whether or not either party is then present in
this state.

17‑4‑611.  Service of process.

(a)  A consent to service of process complying with W.S. 17‑4‑611
required by this act must be signed and filed in the form required by a
rule or order under this act. A consent appointing the secretary of
state the person's agent for service of process in a noncriminal action
or proceeding against the person, or the person's successor or personal
representative under this act or a rule adopted or order issued under
this act after the consent is filed, has the same force and validity as
if the service were made personally on the person filing the consent. A
person that has filed a consent complying with this subsection in
connection with a previous application for registration or notice filing
need not file an additional consent.

(b)  If a person, including a nonresident of this state, engages in an
act, practice, or course of business prohibited or made actionable by
this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act and the person
has not filed a consent to service of process under subsection (a) of
this section, the act, practice, or course of business constitutes the
appointment of the secretary of state as the person's agent for service
of process in a noncriminal action or proceeding against the person or
the person's successor or personal representative.

(c)  Service under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be made by
providing a copy of the process to the office of the secretary of state,
but it is not effective unless:

(i)  The plaintiff, which may be the secretary of state, promptly sends
notice of the service and a copy of the process, return receipt
requested, to the defendant or respondent at the address set forth in
the consent to service of process or, if a consent to service of process
has not been filed, at the last known address, or takes other reasonable
steps to give notice; and

(ii)  The plaintiff files an affidavit of compliance with this
subsection in the action or proceeding on or before the return day of
the process, if any, or within the time that the court, or the secretary
of state in a proceeding before the secretary of state, allows.

(d)  Service pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may be used in a
proceeding before the secretary of state or by the secretary of state in
a civil action in which the secretary of state is the moving party.

(e)  If process is served under subsection (c) of this section, the
court, or the secretary of state in a proceeding before the secretary of
state, shall order continuances as are necessary or appropriate to
afford the defendant or respondent reasonable opportunity to defend.

17‑4‑612.  Severability clause.

If any provision of this act or its application to any person or
circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other
provisions or applications of this act that can be given effect without
the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of
this act are severable.

17‑4‑613.  Securities enforcement and compliance account; purposes.

(a)  There is created the securities enforcement and compliance account.
Funds within the account shall only be expended by legislative
appropriation. All funds within the account shall be invested by the

credited to the general fund.

(b)  The secretary of state shall credit sixty percent (60%) of all fees
collected by the secretary of state under this act to the general fund
and the balance to the securities enforcement and compliance account.

hundred fifty thousand dollars (\$350,000.00) in the securities
enforcement and compliance account shall be credited to the general
fund.

(c)  The secretary of state may expend money within the account created
in subsection (a) of this section as appropriated by the legislature to
investigate, prosecute and otherwise ensure compliance with this act and
to promote investor awareness which may include investment and antifraud
publications and seminars.

(d)  The secretary of state shall develop separately identifiable
biennial expenditure requests using a base budget, standard budget and
exception budget as provided in W.S. 9‑2‑1002 through 9‑2‑1014 for the
purposes specified in this section and from the account created in
subsection (a) of this section.

17‑4‑701.  Application of act to existing proceeding and existing rights
and duties.

17‑7‑303.  Standard of conduct in managing and investing institutional
fund.

(a)  Subject to the intent of a donor expressed in a gift instrument, an
institution, in managing and investing an institutional fund, shall
consider the charitable purposes of the institution and the purposes of
the institutional fund.

(b)  In addition to complying with the duty of loyalty imposed by law
other than this act, each person responsible for managing and investing
an institutional fund shall manage and invest the fund in good faith and
with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would
exercise under similar circumstances.

(c)  In managing and investing an institutional fund, an institution:

(i)  May incur only costs that are appropriate and reasonable in
relation to the assets, the purposes of the institution and the skills
available to the institution; and

(ii)  Shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts relevant to the
management and investment of the fund.

(d)  An institution may pool two (2) or more institutional funds for
purposes of management and investment.

(e)  Except as otherwise provided by a gift instrument, the following
rules shall apply:

(i)  In managing and investing an institutional fund, the following
factors if relevant shall be considered:

(A)  General economic conditions;

(B)  The possible effect of inflation or deflation;

(C)  The expected tax consequences, if any, of investment decisions or
strategies;

(D)  The role that each investment or course of action plays within the
overall investment portfolio of the fund;

(E)  The expected total return from income and the appreciation of
investments;

(F)  Other resources of the institution;

(G)  The needs of the institution and the fund to make distributions and
to preserve capital; and

(H)  An asset's special relationship or special value, if any, to the
charitable purposes of the institution.

(ii)  Management and investment decisions about an individual asset
shall be made not in isolation but rather in the context of the
institutional fund's portfolio of investments as a whole and as a part
of an overall investment strategy having risk and return objectives
reasonably suited to the fund and to the institution;

(iii)  Except as otherwise provided by law other than this act, an
institution may invest in any kind of property or type of investment
consistent with this section;

(iv)  An institution shall diversify the investments of an institutional
fund unless the institution reasonably determines that, because of
special circumstances, the purposes of the fund are better served
without diversification;

(v)  Within a reasonable time after receiving property, an institution
shall make and carry out decisions concerning the retention or
disposition of the property or to rebalance a portfolio in order to
bring the institutional fund into compliance with the purposes, terms
and distribution requirements of the institution as necessary to meet
other circumstances of the institution and the requirements of this act;

(vi)  A person who has special skills or expertise, or is selected in
reliance upon the person's representation that the person has special
skills or expertise, has a duty to use those skills or that expertise in
managing and investing institutional funds.

17‑7‑304.  Appropriation for expenditure or accumulation of endowment
fund; rules of construction.

(a)  Subject to subsection (d) of this section and to the intent of a
donor expressed in the gift instrument, an institution may appropriate
for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as the
institution determines is prudent for the uses, benefits, purposes and
duration for which the endowment fund is established. Unless stated
otherwise in the gift instrument, the assets in an endowment fund are
donor-restricted assets until appropriated for expenditure by the
institution. In making a determination to appropriate or accumulate, the
institution shall act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily
prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar
circumstances, and shall consider, if relevant, the following factors:

(i)  The duration and preservation of the endowment fund;

(ii)  The purposes of the institution and the endowment fund;

(iii)  General economic conditions;

(iv)  The possible effect of inflation or deflation;

(v)  The expected total return from income and the appreciation of
investments;

(vi)  Other resources of the institution; and

(vii)  The investment policy of the institution.

(b)  To limit the authority to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate
under subsection (a) of this section, a gift instrument shall
specifically state the limitation.

(c)  Terms in a gift instrument designating a gift as an endowment, or a
direction or authorization in the gift instrument to use only "income",
"interest", "dividends", or "rents, issues or profits", or "to preserve
the principal intact" or words of similar import:

(i)  Create an endowment fund of permanent duration unless other
language in the gift instrument limits the duration or purpose of the
fund; and

(ii)  Do not otherwise limit the authority to appropriate for
expenditure or accumulate under subsection (a) of this section.

(d)  The appropriation for expenditure in any year of an amount greater
than seven percent (7%) of the fair market value of an endowment fund,
calculated on the basis of market values determined at least quarterly
and averaged over a period of not less than three (3) years immediately
preceding the year in which the appropriation for expenditure is made,
creates a rebuttable presumption of imprudence. For an endowment fund in
existence for fewer than three (3) years, the fair market value of the
endowment fund shall be calculated for the period the endowment fund has
been in existence. This subsection shall not:

(i)  Apply to an appropriation for expenditure permitted under law other
than this act or by the gift instrument; or

(ii)  Create a presumption of prudence for an appropriation for
expenditure of an amount less than or equal to seven percent (7%) of the
fair market value of the endowment fund.

17‑7‑305.  Delegation of management and investment functions.

(a)  Subject to any specific limitation set forth in a gift instrument
or in law other than this act, an institution may delegate to an
external agent the management and investment of an institutional fund to
the extent that an institution could prudently delegate under the
circumstances. An institution shall act in good faith, with the care
that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise
under similar circumstances, in:

(i)  Selecting an agent;

(ii)  Establishing the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent
with the purposes of the institution and the institutional fund; and

(iii)  Periodically reviewing the agent's actions in order to monitor
the agent's performance and compliance with the scope and terms of the
delegation.

(b)  In performing a delegated function, an agent owes a duty to the
institution to exercise reasonable care to comply with the scope and
terms of the delegation.

(c)  An institution that complies with subsection (a) of this section is
not liable for the decisions or actions of an agent to which the
function was delegated.

(d)  By accepting delegation of a management or investment function from
an institution that is subject to the laws of this state, an agent
submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state in all
proceedings arising from or related to the delegation or the performance
of the delegated function.

(e)  An institution may delegate management and investment functions to
its committees, officers or employees as authorized by law of this state
other than this act.

17‑7‑306.  Release or modification of restrictions on management,
investment or purpose.

(a)  If the donor consents in a record, an institution may release or
modify, in whole or in part, a restriction contained in a gift
instrument on the management, investment or purpose of an institutional
fund. A release or modification may not allow a fund to be used for a
purpose other than a charitable purpose of the institution.

(b)  The court upon application of an institution, may modify a
restriction contained in a gift instrument regarding the management or
investment of an institutional fund if the restriction has become
impracticable or wasteful, if it impairs the management or investment of
the fund, or if, because of circumstances not anticipated by the donor,
a modification of a restriction will further the purposes of the fund.
If the institution is a governmental institution as defined by W.S.
17-7-302(a)(iv), the institution shall notify the attorney general of
the application, and the attorney general shall be given an opportunity
to be heard. To the extent practicable, any modification shall be made
in accordance with the donor's probable intention.

(c)  If a particular charitable purpose or a restriction contained in a
gift instrument on the use of an institutional fund becomes unlawful,
impracticable, impossible to achieve or wasteful, the court, upon
application of an institution, may modify the purpose of the fund or the
restriction on the use of the fund in a manner consistent with the
charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument. If the institution
is a governmental institution as defined by W.S. 17‑7‑302(a)(iv), the
institution shall notify the attorney general of the application, and
the attorney general shall be given an opportunity to be heard.

(d)  If an institution determines that a restriction contained in a gift
instrument on the management, investment or purposes of an institutional
fund is unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve or wasteful, the
institution, not less than sixty (60) days after notification to the
attorney general, may release or modify the restriction, in whole or
part, if:

(i)  The institutional fund subject to the restriction has a total value
of less than twenty-five thousand dollars (\$25,000.00);

general partner and by each other general partner designated in the

partners.

(b)  Any person may sign a certificate by an attorney‑in‑fact, but a
power of attorney to sign a certificate relating to the admission of a
general partner shall specifically describe the admission.

(c)  The execution of a certificate by a general partner constitutes an
affirmation under the penalties of perjury that the facts stated therein
are true.

17‑14‑305.  Execution by judicial act.

If a person required by W.S. 17‑14‑304 to execute any certificate fails
or refuses to do so, any other person who is adversely affected by the
failure or refusal, may petition the district court to direct the
execution of the certificate. If the court finds that it is proper for
the certificate to be executed and that any person so designated has
failed or refused to execute the certificate, it shall order the
secretary of state to record an appropriate certificate.

17‑14‑306.  Filing in office of secretary of state.

(a)  Two (2) signed copies of the certificate of limited partnership and
of any certificates of amendment or cancellation (or of any judicial
decree of amendment or cancellation) shall be delivered to the secretary
of state. A person who executes a certificate as an agent or fiduciary
need not exhibit evidence of his authority as a prerequisite to filing.
Unless the secretary of state finds that any certificate does not
conform to law, upon receipt of all filing fees required by law he
shall:

(i)  Endorse on each duplicate original the word "Filed" and the day,
month and year of the filing thereof;

(ii)  File one (1) duplicate original in his office; and

(iii)  Return the other duplicate original to the person who filed it or
his representative.

(b)  Upon the filing of a certificate of amendment (or judicial decree

the effective date of a certificate of cancellation (or a judicial
decree thereof), the certificate of limited partnership is cancelled.

17‑14‑307.  Liability for false statement in certificate.

(a)  If any certificate of limited partnership or certificate of
amendment or cancellation contains a false statement, one who suffers
loss by reliance on the statement may recover damages for the loss from:

(i)  Any person who executes the certificate, or causes another to
execute it on his behalf, and knew, and any general partner who knew or
should have known, the statement to be false at the time the certificate
was executed; and

(ii)  Any general partner who thereafter knows or should have known that
any arrangement or other fact described in the certificate has changed,
making the statement inaccurate in any respect within a sufficient time
before the statement was relied upon reasonably to have enabled that
general partner to cancel or amend the certificate, or to file a
petition for its cancellation or amendment under W.S. 17‑14‑305.

17‑14‑308.  Scope of notice.

The fact that a certificate of limited partnership is on file in the
office of the secretary of state is notice that the partnership is a
limited partnership and the persons designated therein as general
partners are general partners, but it is not notice of any other fact.

17‑14‑309.  Delivery of certificates to limited partners.

Upon the return by the secretary of state pursuant to W.S. 17‑14‑306 of
a certificate marked "Filed", the general partners shall promptly
deliver or mail a copy of the certificate of limited partnership and
each certificate to each limited partner unless the partnership
agreement provides otherwise.

(viii)  Exercising any right or power permitted to limited partners
under this act and not specifically enumerated in this subsection.

partnership.

(d)  A limited partner who knowingly permits his name to be used in the
name of the limited partnership, except under circumstances permitted by

the limited partnership without actual knowledge that the limited
partner is not a general partner.

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a person who
makes a contribution to a business enterprise and erroneously but in
good faith believes that he has become a limited partner in the
enterprise is not a general partner in the enterprise and is not bound
by its obligations by reason of making the contribution, receiving
distributions from the enterprise, or exercising any rights of a limited
partner, if, on ascertaining the mistake, he:

(i)  Causes an appropriate certificate of limited partnership or a
certificate of amendment to be executed and filed; or

(ii)  Withdraws from future equity participation in the enterprise.

(b)  A person who makes a contribution of the kind described in

of the transaction.

17‑14‑501.  Admission of additional general partners.

After the filing of a limited partnership's original certificate of
limited partnership, additional general partners may be admitted as
provided in writing in the partnership agreement or, if the partnership
agreement does not provide in writing for the admission of additional
general partners, with the written consent of all partners.

17‑14‑502.  Events of withdrawal.

at the time, a person ceases to be a general partner of a limited
partnership upon the happening of any of the following events:

provided in W.S. 17‑14‑702;

(ii)  The general partner ceases to be a member of the limited
partnership as provided in W.S. 17‑14‑802;

(iii)  The general partner is removed as a general partner in accordance
with the partnership agreement;

(iv)  Unless otherwise provided in writing in the partnership agreement,
the general partner:

(A)  Makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors;

(B)  Files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy;

(C)  Is adjudicated as bankrupt or insolvent;

(D)  Files a petition or answer seeking for himself any reorganization,

receiver or liquidator of the general partner or of all or any
substantial part of his properties.

(v)  Unless otherwise provided in writing in the partnership agreement,
one hundred twenty (120) days after the commencement of any proceeding
against the general partner seeking reorganization, arrangement,
composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief
under any statute, law or regulation, the proceeding has not been
dismissed, or if within ninety (90) days after the appointment without
his consent or acquiescence of a trustee, receiver or liquidator of the
general partner or of all or any substantial part of his properties, the
appointment is not vacated or stayed or within ninety (90) days after
the expiration of any such stay, the appointment is not vacated;

(vi)  In the case of a general partner who is a natural person:

(A)  His death; or

(B)  The entry by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating him

17‑14‑503.  General powers and liabilities.

(a)  Except as provided in this act, in subsections (b) and (c) of this
section or in the partnership agreement, a general partner of a limited
partnership has the rights and powers and is subject to the restrictions
and liabilities of a partner in a partnership without limited partners.

(b)  A person that becomes a general partner of an existing limited
partnership is not personally liable for an obligation of a limited
partnership incurred before the person became a partner.

(c)  An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited
partnership is a limited liability limited partnership, whether arising
in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the limited
partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or
indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation
solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner of a limited
liability limited partnership. This subsection applies despite anything
inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed immediately
before the election by all the partners to become a limited liability
limited partnership. For purposes of this section, the obligation of a
limited partnership under contract is deemed to arise at the time the
limited partnership entered into the contract.

17‑14‑504.  Contributions by, and distributions to, general partner.

A general partner of a limited partnership may make contributions to the
partnership and share in the profits and losses of, and in the
distributions from, the limited partnership as a general partner. A
general partner also may make contributions to and share in profits,
losses and distributions as a limited partner. A person who is both a
general partner and a limited partner has the rights and powers, and is
subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a general partner and,
except as provided in the partnership agreement, also has the powers,
and is subject to the restrictions, of a limited partner to the extent
of his participation in the partnership as a limited partner.

17‑14‑505.  Voting.

The partnership agreement may grant to all or certain identified general
partners the right to vote (on a per capita or any other basis),
separately or with all or any class of the limited partners, on any
matter.

ARTICLE 6

FINANCE

17‑14‑601.  Form of contribution.

The contribution of a partner may be in cash, property or services
rendered, or a promissory note or other obligation to contribute cash or
property or to perform services.

17‑14‑602.  Liability for contribution.

(a)  A promise by a limited partner to contribute to the limited
partnership is not enforceable unless set out in a writing signed by the
limited partner.

(b)  Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner is
obligated to the limited partnership to perform any enforceable promise
to contribute cash or property or to perform services, even if he is
unable to perform because of death, disability or any other reason. If a
partner does not make the required contribution of property or services,
he is obligated at the option of the limited partnership to contribute
cash equal to that portion of the value (as stated in the partnership
records required to be kept pursuant to W.S. 17‑14‑206) of the stated
contribution that has not been made.

(c)  Unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement, the
obligation of a partner to make a contribution or return money or other
property paid or distributed in violation of this act may be compromised
only by consent of all the partners. Notwithstanding the compromise, a
creditor of a limited partnership who extends credit, or otherwise acts
in reliance on that obligation after the partner signs a writing which
reflects the obligation, and before the amendment or cancellation
thereof to reflect the compromise, may enforce the original obligation.

17‑14‑603.  Sharing of profits and losses.

The profits and losses of a limited partnership shall be allocated among
the partners, and among classes of partners, in the manner provided in

kept pursuant to W.S. 17‑14‑206) of the contributions made by each
partner to the extent they have been received by the partnership and
have not been returned.

17‑14‑604.  Sharing of distributions.

Distributions of cash or other assets of a limited partnership shall be
allocated among the partners, and among classes of partners, in the
manner provided in writing in the partnership agreement. If the
partnership agreement does not so provide in writing, distributions
shall be made on the basis of the value (as stated in the partnership
records required to be kept pursuant to W.S. 17‑14‑206) of the
contributions made by each partner to the extent they have been received
by the partnership and have not been returned.

ARTICLE 7

events specified in the partnership agreement.

partnership agreement and offset the damages against the amount
otherwise distributable to him.

17‑14‑703.  Withdrawal of limited partner.

(a)  A limited partner may withdraw from a limited partnership at the
time or upon the happening of events specified in writing in the
partnership agreement. If the agreement does not specify in writing the

withdraw or a definite time for the dissolution and winding up of the
limited partnership, a limited partner may withdraw upon not less than
six (6) months prior written notice to each general partner at his
address on the books of the limited partnership at its office in this
state. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to limited
partnerships formed under this act prior to July 1, 1999, unless the
limited partnership properly adopts the provisions of subsection (b) of
this section.

(b)  A limited partner may only withdraw from a limited partnership at
the time or upon the happening of events specified in writing in the
partnership agreement. This subsection applies to limited partnerships
formed under this act on or after July 1, 1999. A limited partnership
formed under this act prior to July 1, 1999, may adopt the provisions of
this subsection by filing a certificate of amendment with the secretary
of state after July 1, 1999 that expressly refers to and adopts this
subsection.

17‑14‑704.  Distribution upon withdrawal.

Except as provided in this article, upon withdrawal any withdrawing
partner is entitled to receive any distribution to which he is entitled
under the partnership agreement and, if not otherwise provided in the
agreement, he is entitled to receive, within a reasonable time after
withdrawal, the fair value of his interest in the limited partnership as
of the date of withdrawal based upon his right to share in distributions
from the limited partnership.

17‑14‑705.  Distribution in kind.

Except as provided in writing in the partnership agreement, a partner,
regardless of the nature of his contribution, has no right to demand and
receive any distribution from a limited partnership in any form other
than cash. Except as provided in writing in the partnership agreement, a
partner may not be compelled to accept a distribution of any asset in
kind from a limited partnership to the extent that the percentage of the
asset distributed to him exceeds a percentage of that asset which is
equal to the percentage in which he shares in distributions from the
limited partnership.

17‑14‑706.  Right to distribution.

At the time a partner becomes entitled to receive a distribution, he has
the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor
of the limited partnership with respect to the distribution.

17‑14‑707.  Limitations on distribution.

A partner may not receive a distribution from a limited partnership to
the extent that, after giving effect to the distribution, all
liabilities of the limited partnership, other than liabilities to
partners on account of their partnership interests, exceed the fair
value of the partnership assets.

17‑14‑708.  Liability upon return of contribution.

(a)  If a partner has received the return of any part of his
contribution without violation of the partnership agreement or this act,
he is liable to the limited partnership for a period of one (1) year
thereafter for the amount of the returned contribution, but only to the
extent necessary to discharge the limited partnership's liabilities to
creditors who extended credit to the limited partnership during the
period the contribution was held by the partnership.

(b)  If a partner has received the return of any part of his
contribution in violation of the partnership agreement or this act, he
is liable to the limited partnership for a period of six (6) years
thereafter for the amount of the contribution wrongfully returned.

(c)  A partner receives a return of his contribution to the extent that
a distribution to him reduces his share of the fair value of the net
assets of the limited partnership below the value (as set forth in the
partnership records required to be kept pursuant to W.S. 17‑14‑206) of
his contribution which has not been distributed to him.

ARTICLE 8

ASSIGNMENT OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

A partnership interest is personal property.

17‑14‑802.  Assignment of partnership interest.

Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest
is assignable in whole or in part. An assignment of a partnership
interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee
to become or to exercise any rights of a partner. An assignment entitles
the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution
to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the
partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment
of all his partnership interest.

17‑14‑803.  Rights of creditor.

On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment
creditor of a partner, the court may charge the partnership interest of
the partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with
interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the
rights of an assignee of the partnership interest. This act does not
deprive any partner of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to
his partnership interest.

17‑14‑804.  Right of assignee to become limited partner.

(a)  An assignee of a partnership interest, including an assignee of a
general partner, may become a limited partner if and to the extent that:

(i)  The assignor gives the assignee that right in accordance with
authority described in the partnership agreement; or

(ii)  All other partners consent.

(b)  An assignee who has become a limited partner has, to the extent
assigned, the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and
liabilities, of a limited partner under the partnership agreement and
this act. An assignee who becomes a limited partner also is liable for
the obligations of his assignor to make and return contributions as
provided in articles 6 and 7. However, the assignee is not obligated for
liabilities unknown to the assignee at the time he became a limited
partner.

(c)  If an assignee of a partnership interest becomes a limited partner,
the assignor is not released from his liability to the limited
partnership under W.S. 17‑14‑307 and 17‑14‑602.

17‑14‑805.  Deceased or incompetent partner; dissolved or terminated
partner.

If a partner who is an individual dies or a court of competent
jurisdiction adjudges him to be incompetent to manage his person or his
property, the partner's executor, administrator, guardian, conservator
or other legal representative may exercise all the partner's rights for
the purpose of settling his estate or administering his property,
including any power the partner had to give an assignee the right to
become a limited partner. If a partner is a corporation, trust or other
entity and is dissolved or terminated, the powers of that partner may be
exercised by its legal representative or successor.

ARTICLE 9

DISSOLUTION

17‑14‑901.  Nonjudicial dissolution.

partnership agreement;

(iii)  Written consent of all partners;

remaining general partner; or

(vii)  The failure of the limited partners to admit or appoint another
general partner within ninety (90) days after an event of withdrawal of
the last remaining general partner.

17‑14‑902.  Judicial dissolution.

On application by or for a partner the district court may decree
dissolution of a limited partnership whenever it is not reasonably
practicable to carry on the business in conformity with the partnership
agreement.

17‑14‑903.  Winding up.

Except as provided in the partnership agreement, the general partners
who have not wrongfully dissolved a limited partnership or, if none, the
limited partners, may wind up the limited partnership's affairs; but the
district court may wind up the limited partnership's affairs upon
application of any partner, his legal representative, or assignee.

17‑14‑904.  Distribution of assets.

(a)  Upon the winding up of a limited partnership, the assets shall be
distributed as follows:

(i)  To creditors, including partners who are creditors, to the extent
permitted by law, in satisfaction of liabilities of the limited
partnership other than liabilities for distributions to partners under
W.S. 17‑14‑701 or 17‑14‑704;

(ii)  Except as provided in the partnership agreement, to partners and
former partners in satisfaction of liabilities for distributions under
W.S. 17‑14‑701 or 17‑14‑704; and

first for the return of their contributions and secondly respecting
their partnership interests, in the proportions in which the partners
share in distributions.

17‑14‑905.  Reinstatement following administrative dissolution.

(a)  A Wyoming limited partnership administratively dissolved for
failure to pay fees as provided in W.S. 17‑14‑209(c) may apply to the
secretary of state for reinstatement within two (2) years after the
effective date of dissolution. The application shall recite the name of
the domestic limited partnership and the effective date of its
administrative dissolution.

(b)  A domestic limited partnership applying for reinstatement pursuant
to subsection (a) of this section shall include payment of fees and
taxes then delinquent and a reinstatement certificate fee prescribed by
the secretary of state by rule.

(c)  If the secretary of state determines that the application contains
the information required by subsection (a) of this section, that the
information is correct and the application contains the fees and taxes
required by subsection (b) of this section, he shall cancel the
certificate of dissolution and prepare a certificate of reinstatement
that recites his determination and the effective date of reinstatement,
file the original of the certificate and return a copy to the domestic
limited partnership.

(d)  When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back and takes
effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution
pursuant to W.S. 17‑14‑209(c) and the limited partnership resumes
carrying on its business as if the administrative dissolution had never
occurred.

(e)  The domestic limited partnership shall retain its registered name
during the two (2) year reinstatement period.

receipt for the filing fee. The secretary of state may prescribe rules

document copy, with the filing fee receipt (or acknowledgement of

contained in the document; or

that information contained in the document is correct or incorrect.

the district court of the county where the corporation's principal
office is located in the state or, if the corporation does not have a
principal office in the state, the district court of the county where
its registered office is or will be located, or the district court of
the county of residence of an incorporator for a domestic corporation,
or in the district court of Laramie county. The appeal is commenced by
petitioning the court to compel filing the document and by attaching to
the petition the document and the secretary of state's explanation of
his refusal to file.

(b)  The court may summarily order the secretary of state to file the
document or take other action the court considers appropriate.

proceedings.

17‑16‑127.  Evidentiary effect of copy of filed document.

original document is on file with the secretary of state.

determined under subsection (a) of this section.

17‑16‑603.  Issued and outstanding shares.

is subject to the limitations of subsection (c) of this section and to
W.S. 17‑16‑640.

debt remains unpaid more than twenty (20) days after the corporation
sends written demand for payment to the subscriber.

consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or

of the corporation.

determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares
to be issued is adequate. That determination by the board of directors
is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance
of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid,
and nonassessable.

(d)  When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board
of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued
therefor are fully paid and nonassessable.

(e)  The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract
for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make other
arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit
distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price,
until the services are performed, the note is paid, or the benefits
received. If the services are not performed, the note is not paid, or
the benefits are not received, the shares escrowed or restricted and the
distributions credited may be cancelled in whole or part.

(f)(i)  An issuance of shares or other securities convertible into or
rights exercisable for shares, in a transaction or a series of

consideration other than cash or cash equivalents; and

(A)  For purposes of determining the voting power of shares issued and
issuable as a result of a transaction or series of integrated
transactions, the voting power of shares shall be the greater of:

securities and the exercise of rights to be issued.

transaction is made contingent on consummation of one (1) or more of the
other transactions.

(a)  A corporation may issue rights, options, or warrants for the
purchase of shares of the corporation. The board of directors shall
determine the terms upon which the rights, options, or warrants are
issued and the terms, including the consideration for which the shares
are to be issued. The authorization by the board of directors for the
corporation to issue the rights, options or warrants constitutes
authorization of the issuance of the shares or other securities for
which the rights, options or warrants are exercisable.

(b)  The terms and conditions of such rights, options or warrants,
including those outstanding on July 1, 2009, may include, without
limitation, restrictions or conditions that:

(i)  Preclude or limit the exercise, transfer or receipt of such rights,
options or warrants by any person owning or offering to acquire a
specified number or percentage of the outstanding shares or other
securities of the corporation or by any transferee of any such person;
or

(ii)  Invalidate or void the rights, options or warrants held by any
such person or transferee.

17‑16‑625.  Form and content of certificates.

(a)  Shares may but need not be represented by certificates. Unless this
act or another statute expressly provides otherwise, the rights and
obligations of shareholders are identical whether or not their shares
are represented by certificates.

(b)  At a minimum each share certificate shall state on its face:

(i)  The name of the issuing corporation and that it is organized under
the law of this state;

(ii)  The name of the person to whom issued; and

(iii)  The number and class of shares and the designation of the series,
if any, the certificate represents.

(c)  If the issuing corporation is authorized to issue different classes
of shares or different series within a class, the designations, relative
rights, preferences, and limitations applicable to each class and the
variations in rights, preferences, and limitations determined for each
series, and the authority of the board of directors to determine
variations for future series, shall be summarized on the front or back
of each certificate. Alternatively, each certificate may state
conspicuously on its front or back that the corporation will furnish the
shareholder this information on request in writing and without charge.

(d)  Each share certificate:

(i)  Shall be signed, either manually or in facsimile, by two (2)
officers designated in the bylaws or by the board of directors; and

(ii)  May bear the corporate seal or its facsimile.

(e)  If the person who signed, either manually or in facsimile, a share
certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is issued, the
certificate is nevertheless valid.

(f)  In no case shall a corporation issue share certificates in bearer
form. For purposes of this subsection "bearer form" means a form in
which the certificate is payable to the bearer of the certificate
according to its terms but not by reason of an endorsement. If a
corporation formed under this act or qualified to do business under this
act has bearer shares outstanding, the entity shall conform those shares
to comply with this section on or before October 1, 2007. Failure to do
so shall be prima facie evidence of an ultra vires act pursuant to W.S.
17‑16‑304.

17‑16‑626.  Shares without certificates.

(a)  Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise,
the board of directors of a corporation may authorize the issue of some
or all of the shares of any or all of its classes or series without
certificates. The authorization does not affect shares already
represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the
corporation.

(b)  Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares
without certificates, the corporation shall send the shareholder a
written statement of the information required on certificates by W.S.
17‑16‑625(b) and (c), and, if applicable, W.S. 17‑16‑627.

17‑16‑627.  Restriction on transfer of shares and other securities.

(a)  The articles of incorporation, bylaws, an agreement among
shareholders, or an agreement between shareholders and the corporation
may impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of
shares of the corporation. A restriction does not affect shares issued
before the restriction was adopted unless the holders of the shares are
parties to the restriction agreement or voted in favor of the
restriction.

(b)  A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares
is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the
holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its
existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certificate
or is contained in the information statement required by W.S.
17‑16‑626(b). Unless so noted or contained, a restriction is not
enforceable against a person without knowledge of the restriction.

(c)  A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares
is authorized:

(i)  To maintain the corporation's status when it is dependent on the
number or identity of its shareholders;

(ii)  To preserve exemptions under federal or state securities law; or

(iii)  For any other reasonable purpose.

(d)  A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares
may:

(i)  Obligate the shareholder first to offer the corporation or other
persons, separately, consecutively, or simultaneously, an opportunity to
acquire the restricted shares;

(ii)  Obligate the corporation or other persons, separately,
consecutively, or simultaneously, to acquire the restricted shares;

(iii)  Require the corporation, the holders of any class of its shares,
or another person to approve the transfer of the restricted shares, if
the requirement is not manifestly unreasonable; or

(iv)  Prohibit the transfer of the restricted shares to designated
persons or classes of persons, if the prohibition is not manifestly
unreasonable.

(e)  For purposes of this section, "shares" includes a security
convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.

17‑16‑628.  Expense of issue.

A corporation may pay the expenses of selling or underwriting its
shares, and of organizing or reorganizing the corporation, from the
consideration received for shares.

17‑16‑630.  Shareholders' preemptive rights.

(a)  The shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to
acquire the corporation's unissued shares except to the extent the
articles of incorporation so provide.

(b)  A statement included in the articles of incorporation that "the
corporation elects to have preemptive rights," or words of similar
import, means that the following principles apply except to the extent
the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise:

(i)  The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right,
granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of
directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the
right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued
shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them;

(ii)  A shareholder may waive his preemptive right. A waiver evidenced
by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by
consideration;

(iii)  There is no preemptive right with respect to:

(A)  Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents, or
employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;

(B)  Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to
provide compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the
corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;

(C)  Shares authorized in articles of incorporation that are issued
within six (6) months from the effective date of incorporation; or

(D)  Shares sold otherwise than for money.

(iv)  Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but
with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive
rights with respect to shares of any class;

(v)  Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but
without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no
preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential
rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential
rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire
shares without preferential rights;

(vi)  Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by
shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one (1) year
after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board
of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the
exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or
after the expiration of one (1) year is subject to the shareholders'
preemptive rights.

(c)  For purposes of this section, "shares" includes a security
convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.

17‑16‑631.  Corporation's acquisition of its own shares.

(a)  A corporation may acquire its own shares and shares so acquired
constitute authorized but unissued shares.

(b)  If the articles of incorporation prohibit the reissue of the
acquired shares, the number of authorized shares is reduced by the
number of shares acquired.

(c)  The board of directors may adopt articles of amendment effecting
the provisions of this section under article 10 of this act without
shareholder action and deliver them to the secretary of state for
filing.

17‑16‑640.  Distributions to shareholders.

(a)  A board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make
distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles
of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (c) of this section.

(b)  If the board of directors does not fix the record date for
determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one (1)
involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the
corporation's shares, it is the date the board of directors authorizes
the distribution.

(c)  No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect:

(i)  The corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become
due in the usual course of business; or

(ii)  The corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its
total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation permit
otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to
be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the
preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential
rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.

(d)  The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution
is not prohibited under subsection (c) of this section either on
financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and
principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair
valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.

(e)  Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, the effect of
a distribution under subsection (c) of this section is measured:

(i)  In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other
acquisition of the corporation's shares, as of the earlier of:

(A)  The date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by
the corporation; or

(B)  The date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to
the acquired shares.

(ii)  In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the
date the indebtedness is distributed; and

(iii)  In all other cases, as of:

(A)  The date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs
within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of authorization; or

(B)  The date the payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred
twenty (120) days after the date of authorization.

(f)  A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of
a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with
the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors
except to the extent subordinated by agreement.

(g)  Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a
distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of
determinations under subsection (c) of this section if its terms provide
that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the
extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made
under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution,
each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the
effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.

(h)  This section shall not apply to distributions in liquidation under
article 14 of this act.

ARTICLE 7

SHAREHOLDERS

17‑16‑701.  Annual meeting.

(a)  Unless directors are elected by written consent in lieu of an
annual meeting as permitted by W.S. 17‑16‑704, a corporation shall hold
a meeting of shareholders annually at a time stated in or fixed in
accordance with the bylaws.

(b)  Annual shareholders' meetings may be held in or out of this state
at the place stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws. If no
place is stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws, annual
meetings shall be held at the corporation's principal office. The board
of directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting
shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held by means of
remote communication. The board shall take into consideration
stockholders' ability to participate by remote communication and provide
an alternative means of participation for those stockholders unable to
participate by remote communication. If authorized by the board of
directors in its sole discretion, and subject to guidelines and
procedures the board of directors may adopt, stockholders and proxies
not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of
remote communication:

(i)  Participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

(ii)  Be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders,
whether the meeting is held at a designated place or solely by means of
remote communication, provided that the corporation shall implement
reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and
permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a
stockholder or proxy. The corporations shall implement reasonable
measures to provide the stockholders and proxies a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters
submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear
the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with the
proceeding. If any stockholder or proxy votes or takes other action at
the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of the vote or
other action shall be maintained by the corporation.

(c)  The failure to hold an annual meeting at the time stated in or
fixed in accordance with a corporation's bylaws does not affect the
validity of any corporate action.

17‑16‑702.  Special meeting.

(a)  A corporation shall hold a special meeting of shareholders:

(i)  On call of its board of directors or the person or persons
authorized to do so by the articles of incorporation or bylaws; or

(ii)  If the holders of at least ten percent (10%) of all the votes
entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the
proposed special meeting sign, date, and deliver to the corporation one
(1) or more written demands for the meeting describing the purpose or
purposes for which it is to be held, provided that the articles of
incorporation may fix a lower percentage or a higher percentage not
exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of all the votes entitled to be cast
on any issue proposed to be considered. Unless otherwise provided in the
articles of incorporation, a written demand for a special meeting may be
revoked by a writing to that effect received by the corporation prior to
the receipt by the corporation of demands sufficient in number to
require the holding of a special meeting.

(b)  If not otherwise fixed under W.S. 17‑16‑703 or 17‑16‑707, the
record date for determining shareholders entitled to demand a special
meeting is the date the first shareholder signs the demand.

(c)  Special shareholders' meetings may be held in or out of this state
at the place stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws. If no
place is stated or fixed in accordance with the bylaws, special meetings
shall be held at the corporation's principal office.

(d)  Only business within the purpose or purposes described in the
meeting notice required by W.S. 17‑16‑705(c) may be conducted at a
special shareholders' meeting.

17‑16‑703.  Court-ordered meeting.

(a)  The district court of the county where a corporation's principal
office or, if none in this state, its registered office is located may
summarily order a meeting to be held:

(i)  On application of any shareholder of the corporation entitled to
participate in an annual meeting if an annual meeting was not held or
action by written consent in lieu thereof did not become effective
within the earlier of six (6) months after the end of the corporation's
fiscal year or fifteen (15) months after its last annual meeting; or

(ii)  On application of a shareholder who signed a demand for a special
meeting valid under W.S. 17‑16‑702, if:

(A)  Notice of the special meeting was not given within thirty (30) days
after the date the demand was delivered to the corporation's secretary;
or

(B)  The special meeting was not held in accordance with the notice.

(b)  The court may fix the time and place of the meeting, determine the
shares entitled to participate in the meeting, specify a record date for
determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the
meeting, prescribe the form and content of the meeting notice, fix the
quorum required for specific matters to be considered at the meeting or
direct that the votes represented at the meeting constitute a quorum for
action on those matters, and enter other orders necessary to accomplish
the purpose or purposes of the meeting.

17‑16‑704.  Action without meeting.

(a)  Action required or permitted by this act to be taken at a
shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is
taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action
shall be evidenced by one (1) or more written consents bearing the date
of signature and describing the action taken, signed by the holders of
the requisite number of shares entitled to vote on the action, and
delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with
the corporate records.

(b)  The articles of incorporation may provide that any action required
or permitted by this act to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be
taken without a meeting, and without prior notice, if consents in
writing setting forth the action so taken are signed by the holders of
outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be required to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which
all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted. The
written consent shall bear the date of signature of the shareholder who
signs the consent and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in
the minutes or filing with the corporate records.

(c)  If not otherwise fixed under W.S. 17‑16‑703 or 17‑16‑707, and if
prior board action is not required respecting the action to be taken
without a meeting, the record date for determining shareholders entitled
to take action without a meeting shall be the first date on which a
signed written consent is delivered to the corporation. If not otherwise
fixed under W.S. 17‑16‑707 and if prior board action is required
respecting the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date
shall be the close of business on the day the resolution of the board
taking such prior action is adopted. No written consent shall be
effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless,
within sixty (60) days of the earliest date on which a consent delivered
to the corporation as required by this section was signed, written
consents signed by sufficient shareholders to take the action have been
delivered to the corporation. A written consent may be revoked by a
writing to that effect delivered to the corporation before unrevoked
written consents sufficient in number to take corporate action are
delivered to the corporation.

(d)  A consent signed pursuant to the provisions of this section has the
effect of a vote taken at a meeting and may be described as such in any
document. Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws or a resolution
of the board of directors provides for a reasonable delay to permit
tabulation of written consents, the action taken by written consent
shall be effective when written consents signed by sufficient
shareholders to take the action are delivered to the corporation.

(e)  If this act requires that notice of proposed action be given to
nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by written consent
of the voting shareholders, the corporation shall give its nonvoting
shareholders written notice of the action not more than ten (10) days
after written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered
to the corporation or the later date that tabulation of consents is
completed pursuant to the authorization under subsection (d) of this
section. The notice shall reasonably describe the action taken and
contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under any provision
of this act, would have been required to be sent to nonvoting
shareholders in a notice of meeting at which the proposed action would
have been submitted to the shareholders for action.

(f)  If action is taken by less than unanimous written consent of the
voting shareholders, the corporation shall give its nonconsenting voting
shareholders written notice of the action not more than ten (10) days
after written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered
to the corporation, or the later date that tabulation of consents is
completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection (d) of this
section. The notice shall reasonably describe the action taken and
contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under any provision
of this act, would have been required to be sent to voting shareholders
in a notice of a meeting at which the action would have been submitted
to the shareholders for action.

(g)  The notice requirements in subsections (e) and (f) of this section
shall not delay the effectiveness of actions taken by written consent,
and a failure to comply with such notice requirements shall not
invalidate actions taken by written consent, provided that this
subsection shall not be deemed to limit judicial power to fashion any
appropriate remedy in favor of a shareholder adversely affected by a
failure to give the notice within the required time period.

(h)  An electronic transmission may be used to consent to an action, if
the electronic transmission contains or is accompanied by information
from which the corporation can determine the date on which the
electronic transmission was signed and that the electronic transmission
was authorized by the shareholder, the shareholder's agent or the
shareholder's attorney-in-fact.

(i)  Delivery of a written consent to the corporation under this section
is delivery to the corporation's registered agent at its registered
office or to the secretary of the corporation at its principal office.

17‑16‑705.  Notice of meeting.

(a)  A corporation shall notify shareholders of the date, time, place
and means of communication of each annual and special shareholders'
meeting no fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the
meeting date. Unless this act or the articles of incorporation require
otherwise, the corporation is required to give notice only to
shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting.

(b)  Unless this act or the articles of incorporation require otherwise,
notice of an annual meeting need not include a description of the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

(c)  Notice of a special meeting shall include a description of the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

(d)  If not otherwise fixed under W.S. 17‑16‑703 or 17‑16‑707, the
record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to
vote at an annual or special shareholders' meeting is the day before the
first notice is delivered to shareholders.

(e)  Unless the bylaws require otherwise, if an annual or special
shareholders' meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, place or
means of communication, notice need not be given of the new date, time,
place or means of communication if the new date, time place or means of
communication is announced at the meeting before adjournment. If a new
record date for the adjourned meeting is or shall be fixed under W.S.
17‑16‑707, however, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given under
this section to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.

17‑16‑706.  Waiver of notice.

(a)  A shareholder may waive any notice required by this act, the
articles of incorporation, or bylaws before or after the date and time
stated in the notice. The waiver shall be in writing, be signed or shall
be sent by electronic transmission by the shareholder entitled to the
notice, and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes
or filing with the corporate records.

(b)  A shareholder's attendance at a meeting:

(i)  Waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the
meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects
to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and

(ii)  Waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the
meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the
meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter
when it is presented.

17‑16‑707.  Record date.

(a)  The bylaws may fix or provide the manner of fixing the record date
for one (1) or more voting groups in order to determine the shareholders
entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting, to demand a special
meeting, to vote, or to take any other action. If the bylaws do not fix
or provide for fixing a record date, the board of directors of the
corporation may fix a future date as the record date.

(b)  A record date fixed under this section may not be more than seventy
(70) days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of
shareholders.

(c)  A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
a shareholders' meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting
unless the board of directors fixes a new record date, which it shall do
if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty (120)
days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

(d)  If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than one
hundred twenty (120) days after the date fixed for the original meeting,
it may provide that the original record date continues in effect or it
may fix a new record date.

17‑16‑708.  Conduct of the meeting.

(a)  At each meeting of shareholders, a chair shall preside. The chair
shall be appointed as provided in the bylaws or, in the absence of such
provision, by the board.

(b)  The chair, unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide
otherwise, shall determine the order of business and shall have the
authority to establish rules for the conduct of the meeting.

(c)  Any rules adopted for, and the conduct of, the meeting shall be
fair to shareholders.

(d)  The chair of the meeting shall announce at the meeting when the
polls close for each matter voted upon. If no announcement is made, the
polls shall be deemed to have closed upon the final adjournment of the
meeting. After the polls close, no ballots, proxies or votes nor any
revocations or changes thereto may be accepted.

17‑16‑720.  Shareholders' list for meeting.

(a)  After fixing a record date for a meeting, a corporation shall
prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who
are entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting. The list shall be
arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or
series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by
each shareholder.

(b)  The shareholders' list shall be available for inspection by any
shareholder, beginning two (2) business days after notice of the meeting
is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the
meeting, at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified
in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A
shareholder, his agent, or attorney is entitled on written demand to
inspect and, subject to the requirements of W.S. 17‑16‑1602(c), to copy
the list, during regular business hours and at the shareholder's
expense, during the period it is available for inspection.

(c)  The corporation shall make the shareholders' list available at the
meeting, and any shareholder, his agent, or attorney is entitled to
inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.

(d)  If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder, his agent, or
attorney to inspect the shareholders' list before or at the meeting, or
to copy the list as permitted by subsection (b) of this section, the
district court of the county where a corporation's principal office or,
if none in this state, its registered office, is located, on application
of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the
corporation's expense, order payment by the corporation of the
shareholder's cost of suit including reasonable attorney fees and may
postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the
inspection or copying is complete.

(e)  Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders'
list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting.

17‑16‑721.  Voting entitlement of shares.

(a)  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (d) of this section or
unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, each outstanding
share, regardless of class, is entitled to one (1) vote on each matter
voted on at a shareholders' meeting. Only shares are entitled to vote.

(b)  Unless authorized by a district court, the shares of a corporation
are not entitled to vote if they are owned, directly or indirectly, by a
second corporation, domestic or foreign, and the first corporation owns,
directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares entitled to vote for
directors of the second corporation.

(c)  Subsection (b) of this section does not limit the power of a
corporation to vote any shares, including its own shares, held by it in
a fiduciary capacity.

(d)  Redeemable shares are not entitled to vote after notice of
redemption is mailed to the holders and a sum sufficient to redeem the
shares has been deposited with a bank, trust company, or other financial
institution under an irrevocable obligation to pay the holders the
redemption price on surrender of the shares.

17‑16‑722.  Proxies.

(a)  A shareholder may vote his shares in person or by proxy.

(b)  A shareholder or his agent or attorney-in-fact may appoint a proxy
to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment
form or by an electronic transmission. An electronic transmission shall
contain or be accompanied by information from which one can determine
that the shareholder, the shareholder's agent, or the shareholder's
attorney-in-fact authorized the electronic transmission.

(c)  An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment
form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the
inspector of election or the officer or agent of the corporation
authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for eleven (11)
months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment
form.

(d)  An appointment of a proxy is revocable unless the appointment form
or electronic transmission states that it is irrevocable and the
appointment is coupled with an interest. Appointments coupled with an
interest include the appointment of:

(i)  A pledgee;

(ii)  A person who purchased or agreed to purchase the shares;

(iii)  A creditor of the corporation who extended it credit under terms
requiring the appointment;

(iv)  An employee of the corporation whose employment contract requires
the appointment; or

(v)  A party to a voting agreement created under W.S. 17‑16‑731.

(e)  The death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy does
not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy's authority
unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or
other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy
exercises his authority under the appointment.

(f)  An appointment made irrevocable under subsection (d) of this
section is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is
extinguished.

(g)  A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable
appointment may revoke the appointment if he did not know of its
existence when he acquired the shares and the existence of the
irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate
representing the shares or on the information statement for shares
without certificates.

(h)  Subject to W.S. 17‑16‑724 and to any express limitation on the
proxy's authority stated in the appointment form or electronic
transmission, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or
other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.

17‑16‑723.  Shares held by nominees.

(a)  A corporation may establish a procedure by which the beneficial
owner of shares that are registered in the name of a nominee is
recognized by the corporation as the shareholder. The extent of this
recognition may be determined in the procedure.

(b)  The procedure may set forth:

(i)  The types of nominees to which it applies;

(ii)  The rights or privileges that the corporation recognizes in a
beneficial owner;

(iii)  The manner in which the procedure is selected by the nominee;

(iv)  The information that shall be provided when the procedure is
selected;

(v)  The period for which selection of the procedure is effective; and

(vi)  Other aspects of the rights and duties created.

17‑16‑724.  Corporation's acceptance of votes.

(a)  If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment
corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the corporation if acting in
good faith is entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver, or proxy
appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder.

(b)  If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment
does not correspond to the name of its shareholder, the corporation if
acting in good faith is nevertheless entitled to accept the vote,
consent, waiver, or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of
the shareholder if:

(i)  The shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports to be
that of an officer or agent of the entity;

(ii)  The name signed purports to be that of an administrator, executor,

corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the
corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, consent,
waiver, or proxy appointment;

bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence
of this status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with
respect to the vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment;

(iv)  The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial
owner, or attorney‑in‑fact of the shareholder and, if the corporation
requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory's
authority to sign for the shareholder has been presented with respect to
the vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment; or

(v)  Two (2) or more persons are the shareholder as cotenants or
fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one
(1) of the coowners and the person signing appears to be acting on
behalf of all the coowners.

(c)  The corporation is entitled to reject a vote, consent, waiver, or
proxy appointment if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized
to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt
about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory's
authority to sign for the shareholder.

(d)  The corporation and its officer or agent who accepts or rejects a
vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment in good faith and in
accordance with the standards of this section or W.S. 17‑16‑722(b) are
not liable in damages to the shareholder for the consequences of the
acceptance or rejection.

(e)  Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a vote,
consent, waiver, or proxy appointment under this section or W.S.
17‑16‑722(b) is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction
determines otherwise.

17‑16‑725.  Quorum and voting requirements for voting groups.

(a)  Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action
on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with
respect to that matter. Unless the articles of incorporation or this act
provide otherwise, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for
action on that matter.

(b)  Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is
deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and
for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or shall
be set for that adjourned meeting.

(c)  If a quorum exists, action on a matter other than the election of
directors by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the
voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the
action, unless the articles of incorporation or this act require a
greater number of affirmative votes.

(d)  An amendment of articles of incorporation adding, changing or
deleting a quorum or voting requirement for a voting group greater or
lesser than specified in subsection (a) or (c) of this section is
governed by W.S. 17‑16‑727.

voted upon by that voting group as provided in W.S. 17‑16‑725.

(b)  If the articles of incorporation or this act provide for voting by
two (2) or more voting groups on a matter, action on that matter is
taken only when voted upon by each of those voting groups counted
separately as provided in W.S. 17‑16‑725. Action may be taken by one (1)
voting group on a matter even though no action is taken by another
voting group entitled to vote on the matter.

17‑16‑727.  Changing quorum or voting requirements.

(a)  The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser
quorum or voting requirement for shareholders, or voting groups of
shareholders, than is provided for by this act.

(b)  An amendment to the articles of incorporation that adds, changes or
deletes a quorum or voting requirement shall meet the same quorum
requirement and be adopted by the same vote and voting groups required
to take action under the quorum and voting requirements then in effect
or proposed to be adopted, whichever is greater.

17‑16‑728.  Voting for directors; cumulative voting.

(a)  Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation,
directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares
entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is
present.

(b)  Shareholders do not have a right to cumulate their votes for
directors unless the articles of incorporation so provide.

(c)  A statement included in the articles of incorporation that "\[all\]
\[a designated voting group of\] shareholders are entitled to cumulate
their votes for directors," or words of similar import, means that the
shareholders designated are entitled to multiply the number of votes
they are entitled to cast by the number of directors for whom they are
entitled to vote and cast the product for a single candidate or
distribute the product among two (2) or more candidates.

(d)  Shares otherwise entitled to vote cumulatively may not be voted
cumulatively at a particular meeting unless:

states conspicuously that cumulative voting is authorized; or

(ii)  A shareholder who has the right to cumulate his votes gives notice
to the corporation not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time
set for the meeting of the shareholder's intent to cumulate his votes
during the meeting. If one (1) shareholder gives this notice all other
shareholders in the same voting group participating in the election are
entitled to cumulate their votes without giving further notice.

17‑16‑729.  Inspectors of election.

(a)  A public corporation shall, and any other corporation may, appoint
one (1) or more inspectors to act at a meeting of shareholders and make

on a trustee the right to vote or otherwise act for them, by signing an
agreement setting out the provisions of the trust, which may include
anything consistent with its purpose, and transferring their shares to
the trustee. When a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall
prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial
interests in the trust, together with the number and class of shares
each transferred to the trust, and deliver copies of the list and
agreement to the corporation's principal office.

(b)  A voting trust becomes effective on the date the first shares
subject to the trust are registered in the trustee's name. A voting
trust is valid for not more than ten (10) years after its effective date
unless extended under subsection (c) of this section.

(c)  All or some of the parties to a voting trust may extend it for
additional terms of not more than ten (10) years each by signing written
consent to the extension. An extension is valid for ten (10) years from
the date the first shareholder signs the extension agreement. The voting
trustee shall deliver copies of the extension agreement and list of
beneficial owners to the corporation's principal office. An extension
agreement binds only those parties signing it.

17‑16‑731.  Voting agreements.

(a)  Two (2) or more shareholders may provide for the manner in which
they will vote their shares by signing an agreement for that purpose. A
voting agreement created under this section is not subject to the

(b)  A voting agreement created under this section is specifically
enforceable.

17‑16‑732.  Shareholder agreements.

(a)  An agreement among the shareholders of a corporation that complies
with this section is effective among the shareholders and the
corporation even though it is inconsistent with one (1) or more other
provisions of this act in that it:

(i)  Eliminates the board of directors or restricts the discretion or
powers of the board of directors;

(ii)  Governs the authorization or making of distributions whether or

or division of voting power by or between the shareholders and directors
or by or among any of them, including use of weighted voting rights or
director proxies;

transfer or use of property or the provision of services between the
corporation and any shareholder, director, officer or employee of the
corporation or among any of them;

(vi)  Transfers to one (1) or more shareholders or other persons all or
part of the authority to exercise the corporate powers or to manage the
business and affairs of the corporation, including the resolution of any
issue about which there exists a deadlock among directors or
shareholders;

(vii)  Requires dissolution of the corporation at the request of one (1)
or more of the shareholders or upon the occurrence of a specified event
or contingency; or

(viii)  Otherwise governs the exercise of the corporate powers or the
management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the
relationship among the shareholders, the directors and the corporation,
or among any of them, and is not contrary to public policy.

(b)  An agreement authorized by this section shall be:

(i)  Set forth:

(A)  In the articles of incorporation or bylaws and approved by all
persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement; or

(B)  In a written agreement that is signed by all persons who are
shareholders at the time of the agreement and which agreement is made
known to the corporation.

(ii)  Subject to amendment only by all persons who are shareholders at
the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise; and

(iii)  Valid for ten (10) years, unless the agreement provides
otherwise. Nothing herein affects agreements in force on July 1, 1997.

(c)  The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be
noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for
outstanding shares or on the information statement required by W.S.
17‑16‑626(b). If at the time of the agreement the corporation has shares
outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall
the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that
comply with this subsection. The failure to note the existence of the
agreement on the certificate or information statement shall not affect
the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it. Any
purchaser of shares who, at the time of purchase, did not have knowledge
of the existence of the agreement shall be entitled to rescission of the
purchase. A purchaser shall be deemed to have knowledge of the existence
of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or
information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection
and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information
statement is delivered to the purchaser at or prior to the time of
purchase of the shares. An action to enforce the right of rescission
authorized by this subsection must be commenced within the earlier of
ninety (90) days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or
two (2) years after the time of purchase of the shares.

(d)  An agreement authorized by this section shall cease to be effective
when the corporation becomes a public corporation. If the agreement
ceases to be effective for any reason, the board of directors may, if
the agreement is contained or referred to in the corporation's articles
of incorporation or bylaws, adopt an amendment to the articles of
incorporation or bylaws, without shareholder action, to delete the
agreement and any references to it.

(e)  An agreement authorized by this section that limits the discretion
or powers of the board of directors shall relieve the directors of, and
impose upon the person or persons in whom such discretion or powers are
vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to
the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by
the agreement.

(f)  The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this
section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any
shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the
agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a
partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities
otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.

(g)  Incorporators or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders
with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no shares
have been issued when the agreement is made.

shareholder of the corporation unless the articles of incorporation or
bylaws so prescribe.

17‑16‑803.  Number and election of directors.

(a)  A board of directors shall consist of one (1) or more individuals,

maximum number of directors. If a variable range is established, the
number of directors may be fixed or changed from time to time within the
minimum and maximum, by the shareholders or the board of directors.
After shares are issued, only the shareholders may change the range for
the size of the board or change from a fixed to a variable‑range size
board or vice versa.

17‑16‑804.  Election of directors by certain classes of shareholders.

If the articles of incorporation authorize dividing the shares into
classes, the articles may also authorize the election of all or a
specified number of directors by the holders of one (1) or more
authorized classes of shares. A class or classes of shares entitled to
elect one (1) or more directors is a separate voting group for purposes
of the election of directors.

17‑16‑805.  Terms of directors generally.

(a)  The terms of the initial directors of a corporation expire at the
first shareholders' meeting at which directors are elected.

(b)  The terms of all other directors expire at the next, or if their

three (3) groups, with each group containing one-half (1/2) or one-third
(1/3) of the total, as near as may be practicable. In that event, the
terms of directors in the first group expire at the first annual
shareholders' meeting after their election, the terms of the second
group expire at the second annual shareholders' meeting after their
election, and the terms of the third group, if any, expire at the third
annual shareholders' meeting after their election. At each annual
shareholders' meeting held thereafter, directors shall be chosen for a
term of two (2) years or three (3) years, as the case may be, to succeed
those whose terms expire.

17‑16‑807.  Resignation of directors.

(a)  A director may resign at any time by written notice or by
electronic transmission delivered to the board of directors, its
chairman, or to the corporation.

(b)  A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless

without cause unless the articles of incorporation provide that
directors may be removed only for cause.

the shareholders of that voting group may participate in the vote to
remove that director.

(c)  If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed
if the number of votes sufficient to elect the director under cumulative
voting is voted against his removal. If cumulative voting is not
authorized, a director may be removed only if the number of votes cast
to remove the director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove
the director.

(d)  A director may be removed by the shareholders only at a meeting
called for the purpose of removing the director and the meeting notice
shall state that the purpose, or one (1) of the purposes, of the meeting
is removal of the director.

17‑16‑809.  Removal of directors by judicial proceeding.

(a)  The district court of the county where a corporation's principal
office, or if none in this state, its registered office, is located may
remove a director of the corporation from office in a proceeding
commenced by or in the right of the corporation if the court finds that:

(i)  The director engaged in fraudulent conduct with respect to the
corporation or its shareholders, grossly abused the position of
director, or intentionally inflicted harm on the corporation; and

(ii)  Considering the director's course of conduct and the inadequacy of
other available remedies, removal would be in the best interest of the
corporation.

(b)  A shareholder proceeding on behalf of the corporation under
subsection (a) of this section shall comply with all of the requirements
of W.S. 17‑16‑740 through 17‑16‑747 excluding W.S. 17‑16‑741(a)(i).

vacancy occurs on a board of directors, including a vacancy resulting
from an increase in the number of directors:

(i)  The shareholders may fill the vacancy;

(ii)  The board of directors may fill the vacancy; or

(iii)  If the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a
quorum of the board, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote
of a majority of all the directors remaining in office.

(b)  If the vacant office was held by a director elected by a voting
group of shareholders, only the holders of shares of that voting group
are entitled to vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the
shareholders, and only the directors elected by that voting group are
entitled to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the directors.

(c)  A vacancy that will occur at a later date, by reason of a
resignation effective at a later date under W.S. 17‑16‑807(b) or
otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy occurs but the new director
may not take office until the vacancy occurs.

17‑16‑811.  Compensation of directors.

Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the
board of directors may fix the compensation of directors.

17‑16‑820.  Meetings.

(a)  The board of directors may hold regular or special meetings within
or outside of this state.

(b)  Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise,
the board of directors may permit any or all directors to participate in
a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use
of, any means of communication, including electronic transmission by
which all directors participating may communicate with each other during
the meeting. A director participating in a meeting by this means is
deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

17‑16‑821.  Action without meeting.

(a)  Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise,
action required or permitted by this act to be taken at a board of
directors' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken
by the requisite number of members of the board. The action shall be
evidenced by one (1) or more written consents describing the action
taken, signed by the requisite number of directors, or shall be sent by
electronic transmission by the requisite number of directors, and shall
be included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records
reflecting the action taken.

(b)  Action taken under this section is the act of the board of
directors when one (1) or more consents signed by the requisite number
of directors are delivered to the corporation. The consent may specify
the time at which the action taken thereunder is to be effective. A
director's consent may be withdrawn by a revocation signed by the
director and delivered to the corporation prior to delivery to the
corporation of unrevoked written consents signed by the requisite number
of directors. If action is taken by less than unanimous written consent
of the directors, the corporation shall give the nonconsenting or
nonvoting directors written notice of the action not more than ten (10)
days after written consents sufficient to take the action have been
delivered to the corporation. The notice shall reasonably describe the
action taken. The requirement to give the notice shall not delay the
effectiveness of actions taken by the written consent, and a failure to
comply with the notice requirements shall not invalidate actions taken
by written consent, provided that this subsection shall not be deemed to
limit judicial power to fashion any appropriate remedy in favor of a
director adversely affected by a failure to give the notice within the

director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the
corporation's request as a director, officer, manager, partner, trustee,
employee or agent of another entity or employee benefit plan. A director
or officer is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the

impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, the individual to
the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. "Director"
or "officer" includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate
or personal representative of a director or officer;

a proceeding.

17‑16‑851.  Permissible indemnification.

(B)  He reasonably believed that his conduct was in or at least not
opposed to the corporation's best interests; and

(C)  In the case of any criminal proceeding, the director had no

purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the interests of the
participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies
the requirement of subparagraph (a)(i)(B) of this section.

(c)  The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not,
of itself, determinative that the director did not meet the standard of
conduct described in this section.

(d)  Unless ordered by a court under W.S. 17‑16‑854(a)(iii) a
corporation may not indemnify a director under this section:

(i)  In connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the
corporation, except for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with
the proceeding if it is determined that the director has met the
standard of conduct under subsection (a) of this section; or

which he was adjudged liable on the basis that he received a financial

(a)  A corporation may, before final disposition of a proceeding,

if he delivers to the corporation:

(i)  A written affirmation of his good faith belief that the standard of
conduct described in W.S. 17‑16‑851 has been met by the director or that
the proceeding involves conduct for which liability has been eliminated
under a provision of the articles of incorporation as authorized by W.S.
17‑16‑202(b)(iv); and

(ii)  His written undertaking to repay any funds advanced if the
director is not entitled to mandatory indemnification under W.S.
17‑16‑852 and it is ultimately determined under W.S. 17‑16‑854 or
17‑16‑855 that he has not met the standard of conduct described in W.S.
17‑16‑851.

(iii)  Repealed By Laws 1997, ch. 190, § 3.

necessary, the court shall:

(i)  Order indemnification if the court determines that the director is
entitled to mandatory indemnification under W.S. 17‑16‑852;

(ii)  Order indemnification or advance for expenses if the court
determines that the director is entitled to indemnification or advance
for expenses pursuant to a provision authorized by W.S. 17‑16‑858(a); or

(iii)  Order indemnification or advance for expenses if the court
determines, in view of all the relevant circumstances, that it is fair
and reasonable:

in W.S. 17‑16‑851(d)(i) or (ii), but if the director was adjudged so
liable his indemnification shall be limited to expenses incurred in
connection with the proceeding.

(b)  If the court determines that the director is entitled to
indemnification under paragraph (a)(i) of this section or to
indemnification or advance for expenses under paragraph (a)(ii) of this
section, it shall also order the corporation to pay the director's

indemnification or advance for expenses.

(a)  A corporation may not indemnify a director under W.S. 17‑16‑851

the director has met the standard of conduct set forth in W.S.
17‑16‑851.

(b)  The determination shall be made:

(i)  If there are two (2) or more qualified directors, by the board of
directors by majority vote of all the qualified directors (a majority of
whom shall for such purpose constitute a quorum), or by a majority of
the members of a committee of two (2) or more qualified directors
appointed by such a vote;

(ii)  By special legal counsel:

(A)  Selected in the manner prescribed in paragraph (i) of this
subsection; or

corporation other than for expenses incurred in connection with the
proceeding; or

(iii)  A corporation may also indemnify and advance expenses to a
current or former officer, employee or agent who is not a director to
the extent, consistent with public policy, that may be provided by its
articles of incorporation, bylaws, general or specific action of its
board of directors or contract.

(b)  The provisions of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section shall apply to
an officer who is also a director if the basis on which he is made a
party to the proceeding is an act or omission solely as an officer.

mandatory indemnification under W.S. 17‑16‑852, and may apply to a court
under W.S. 17‑16‑854 for indemnification or an advance for expenses, in
each case to the same extent to which a director may be entitled to
indemnification or advance for expenses under those provisions.

or agent of another domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other entity, against
liability asserted against or incurred by the individual in that
capacity or arising from his status as a director or officer whether or
not the corporation would have power to indemnify or advance expenses to
the individual against the same liability under this subarticle.

or bylaws or in a resolution adopted or a contract approved by its board
of directors or shareholders, obligate itself in advance of the act or
omission giving rise to a proceeding to provide indemnification in
accordance with W.S. 17‑16‑851 or advance funds to pay for or reimburse
expenses in accordance with W.S. 17‑16‑853. Any such obligatory
provision shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for authorization
referred to in W.S. 17‑16‑853(c) and 17‑16‑855(c). Any provision that
obligates the corporation to provide indemnification to the fullest
extent permitted by law shall be deemed to obligate the corporation to

specifically provides otherwise.

(b)  Any provision pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall not
obligate the corporation to indemnify or advance expenses to a director
of a predecessor of the corporation, pertaining to conduct with respect

provision for indemnification or advance for expenses in the articles of
incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors or
shareholders of a predecessor of the corporation in a merger or in a
contract to which the predecessor is a party, existing at the time the
merger takes effect, shall be governed by W.S. 17‑16‑1107(a)(iv).

(c)  A corporation may, by provision in its articles of incorporation,
limit any of the rights to indemnification or advance for expenses
created by or pursuant to this subarticle.

(d)  This subarticle does not limit a corporation's power to pay or
reimburse expenses incurred by a director or officer in connection with
his appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when he is not a

person described in W.S. 17‑16‑860(a)(v)(E) or (F) is a party to or has
a material financial interest in the transaction, the conflicted
director is not obligated to make required disclosure to the extent that
the director reasonably believes that doing so would violate a duty

or a professional ethics rule, provided that the conflicted director
discloses to the qualified directors voting on the transaction:

(i)  All information required to be disclosed that is not so violative;

(ii)  The existence and nature of the director's conflicting interest;
and

(iii)  The nature of the conflicted director's duty not to disclose the
confidential information.

(c)  A majority, but no fewer than two (2), of all the qualified
directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, constitutes a
quorum for purposes of action that complies with this section.

(d)  Where directors' action under this section does not satisfy a

which action directors who are not qualified directors may participate.

17‑16‑863.  Shareholders' action.

(a)  Shareholders' action respecting a director's conflicting interest
transaction is effective for purposes of W.S. 17‑16‑861(b)(ii) if a
majority of the votes cast by the holders of all qualified shares are in
favor of the transaction after:

(i)  Notice to shareholders describing the action to be taken respecting
the transaction;

(ii)  Provision to the corporation of the information referred to in
subsection (b) of this section; and

(iii)  Communication to the shareholders entitled to vote on the
transaction of the information that is the subject of required
disclosure, or modified disclosure as described in W.S. 17‑16‑862(b) if
the director's conflicting interest transaction is of the type described
in that subsection, to the extent the information is not known by them.

(b)  A director who has a conflicting interest respecting the
transaction shall, before the shareholders' vote, inform the secretary
or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate
votes, in writing, of the number of shares that the director knows are
not qualified shares under subsection (c) of this section and the
identity of the holders of those shares.

(c)  For purposes of this section:

(i)  "Holder" means and "held by" refers to shares held by both a record
shareholder, as defined in W.S. 17‑16‑1301(a)(vi), and a beneficial
shareholder as defined in W.S. 17‑16‑1301(a)(i);

(ii)  "Qualified shares" means all shares entitled to be voted with
respect to the transaction except for shares that the secretary or other
officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes either
knows, or under subsection (b) of this section is notified, are held by:

transaction; or

(B)  A related person of the director, excluding a person described in
W.S. 17‑16‑860(a)(v)(F).

(d)  A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all
qualified shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of compliance with
this section. Subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this
section, shareholders' action that otherwise complies with this section
is not affected by the presence of holders, or by the voting, of shares
that are not qualified shares.

(e)  If a shareholders' vote does not comply with subsection (a) of this
section solely because of a director's failure to comply with subsection
(b) of this section, and if the director establishes that the failure
was not intended to influence and did not in fact determine the outcome
of the vote, the court may give the effect, if any, to the shareholders'
vote, as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.

(f)  Where shareholders' action under this section does not satisfy a
quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization of the
transaction by reason of the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or a
provision of law, independent action to satisfy those authorization
requirements must be taken by the shareholders, in which action shares
that are not qualified shares may participate.

17‑16‑870.  Business opportunities.

(a)  A director's taking advantage, directly or indirectly, of a
business opportunity may not be the subject of equitable relief, or give
rise to an award of damages or other relief against the director, in a
proceeding by or in the right of the corporation on the ground that the
opportunity should have first been offered to the corporation, if before
becoming legally obligated respecting the opportunity the director
brings it to the attention of the corporation and:

(i)  Action by qualified directors disclaiming the corporation's
interest in the opportunity is taken in compliance with the procedures
set forth in W.S. 17‑16‑862, as if the decision being made concerned a
director's conflicting interest transaction; or

(ii)  Shareholders' action disclaiming the corporation's interest in the
opportunity is taken in compliance with the procedures set forth in W.S.
17‑16‑863, as if the decision being made concerned a director's
conflicting interest transaction, except that, rather than making
required disclosure as defined in W.S. 17‑16‑860, in each case the
director shall have made prior disclosure to those acting on behalf of
the corporation of all material facts concerning the business
opportunity that are then known to the director.

(b)  In any proceeding seeking equitable relief or other remedies based
upon an alleged improper taking advantage of a business opportunity by a
director, the fact that the director did not employ the procedure
described in subsection (a) of this section before taking advantage of
the opportunity shall not create an inference that the opportunity
should have been first presented to the corporation or alter the burden
of proof otherwise applicable to establish that the director breached a
duty to the corporation in the circumstances.

section to amend or repeal a bylaw that changes the quorum or voting

(ii)  To be elected, a nominee shall have received a plurality of the
votes cast by holders of shares entitled to vote in the election at a
meeting at which a quorum is present, provided that a nominee who is

but receives more votes against than for election shall not serve as a
director beyond the ninety (90) day period referenced above; and

directors by a voting group if at the expiration of the time fixed under
a provision requiring advance notification of director candidates, or
absent such a provision, at a time fixed by the board of directors which

meeting at which the election is to occur, there are more candidates for
election by the voting group than the number of directors to be elected,
one (1) or more of whom are properly proposed by shareholders. An
individual shall not be considered a candidate for purposes of this
subsection if the board of directors determines before the notice of
meeting is given that such individual's candidacy does not create a bona
fide election contest.

(c)  A bylaw electing to be governed by this section may be repealed:

(i)  If originally adopted by the shareholders, only by the
shareholders, unless the bylaw otherwise provides; or

(ii)  If adopted by the board of directors, by the board of directors or

survivor's articles of incorporation or organic documents; and

(v)  Any other provisions required by the laws under which any party to
the merger is organized or by which it is governed, or by the articles
of incorporation or organic document of any party to the merger.

(d)  The terms of the plan of merger may be made dependent on facts
objectively ascertainable outside the plan.

(e)  The plan of merger may also include a provision that the plan may
be amended prior to filing articles of merger, but if the shareholders
of a domestic corporation that is a party to the merger are required or
permitted to vote on the plan, the plan must provide that subsequent to
approval of the plan by the shareholders the plan may not be amended to
change:

(i)  The disposition of shares or other securities, eligible interests,
obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or eligible
interests, cash, or other property, if any, to be received under the
plan by the shareholders of or owners of eligible interests in any party
to the merger;

(ii)  The articles of incorporation of any corporation, or the organic
documents of any unincorporated entity, that will survive or be created
as a result of the merger, except for changes permitted by W.S.
17‑16‑1005 or by comparable provisions of the organic laws of any such
foreign corporation or domestic or foreign unincorporated entity; or

(iii)  Any of the other terms or conditions of the plan if the change
would adversely affect such shareholders in any material respect.

(f)  Property held in trust or for charitable purposes under the laws of

required by and pursuant to the laws of this state.

17‑16‑1103.  Share exchange.

(a)  Through a share exchange:

(i)  A domestic corporation may acquire all of the shares of one (1) or
more classes or series of shares of another domestic or foreign
corporation, or all of the interests of one (1) or more classes or
series of interests of a domestic or foreign other entity, in exchange
for shares or other securities, interests, obligations, rights to
acquire shares or other securities, cash, other property, or any
combination of the foregoing, pursuant to a plan of share exchange; or

(ii)  All of the shares of one (1) or more classes or series of shares

plan of share exchange.

(b)  A foreign corporation or eligible entity, may be a party to a share
exchange only if the share exchange is permitted by the organic law
under which the corporation or other entity is organized or by which it
is governed. If Wyoming law does not otherwise provide procedures for
the approval of a share exchange, a plan of share exchange may be
adopted and approved, and the share exchange effectuated, in accordance
with the procedures, if any, for a merger. If Wyoming law does not
otherwise provide procedures for the approval of either a share exchange
or a merger, a plan of share exchange may be adopted and approved, the
share exchange effectuated, and appraisal rights exercised, in
accordance with the procedures in this article and article 13 of this
chapter. For the purposes of applying this article and article 13 of
this chapter:

(i)  The other entity, its interest holders, interests and organic
documents taken together shall be deemed to be a domestic business
corporation, shareholders, shares and articles of incorporation,
respectively and vice versa as the context may require; and

group of persons that is not identical to the interest holders, that
group shall be deemed to be the board of directors.

(c)  The plan of exchange shall include:

(i)  The name of each corporation or other entity whose shares or
interests will be acquired and the name of the corporation or other
entity that will acquire those shares or interests;

(ii)  The terms and conditions of the share exchange;

(iii)  The manner and basis of exchanging the shares of a corporation or
interests in any other entity whose shares or interests will be acquired
under the share exchange into shares or other securities, interests,
obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests,
cash, other property or any combination of the foregoing; and

(iv)  Any other provisions required by the laws under which any party to
the share exchange is organized or by the articles of incorporation or
organic document of any party to the share exchange.

(d)  Terms of a plan of share exchange may be made dependent on facts
objectively ascertainable outside the plan.

(e)  The plan of share exchange may also include a provision that the
plan may be amended prior to filing articles of share exchange, but if
the shareholders of a domestic corporation that is a party to the share
exchange are required or permitted to vote on the plan, the plan shall
provide that subsequent to approval of the plan by the shareholders the
plan may not be amended to change:

(i)  The amount or kind of shares or other securities, interests,
obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests,
cash, or other property to be issued by the corporation or to be
received under the plan by the shareholders of or owners of interests in
any party to the share exchange; or

(ii)  Any of the other terms or conditions of the plan if the change
would adversely affect the shareholders of the domestic corporation in
any material respect.

(f)  This section does not limit the power of a domestic corporation to
acquire shares of another corporation or interests in another entity in
a transaction other than a share exchange.

17‑16‑1104.  Action on plan of merger or share exchange.

(a)  In the case of a domestic corporation that is a party to a merger
or share exchange, the plan of merger or share exchange shall be adopted
by the board of directors. After adopting a plan of merger or share
exchange, the board of directors except as provided in subsection (g) of
this section and W.S. 17‑16‑1105, shall submit the plan to the
shareholders for their approval. The board of directors shall also
transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders
approve the plan, unless the board of directors makes a determination
that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it
should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of
directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for that
determination.

(b)  Reserved.

(c)  The board of directors may condition its submission of the proposed
merger or share exchange to the shareholders on any basis.

(d)  If the plan of merger or share exchange is required to be approved
by the shareholders and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the
corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to
vote, of the shareholders' meeting at which the plan is to be submitted
for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one (1) of the
purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and contain or be
accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to
be merged into an existing corporation or other entity, the notice shall
also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of
incorporation or organizational documents of that corporation or other
entity. If the corporation is to be merged into a corporation or other
entity that is to be created pursuant to the merger, the notice shall
include or be accompanied by a copy or a summary of the articles of
incorporation or organizational documents of the new corporation or
other entity.

(e)  Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors
acting pursuant to subsection (c) of this section require a greater vote
or a greater number of votes to be present, approval of the plan of
merger or share exchange requires the approval of the shareholders at a
meeting at which a quorum exists, and, if any class or series of shares
is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger or share
exchange, the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting
at which a quorum of the voting group is present.

(f)  Separate voting by voting groups is required:

(i)  On a plan of merger by each class or series of shares that:

(A)  Are to be converted under the plan of merger into other securities,
interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or
interests, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing; or

(B)  Would be entitled to vote as a separate group on a provision in the
plan that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of
incorporation, would require action by separate voting groups under W.S.
17‑16‑1004;

(ii)  On a plan of share exchange by each class or series of shares
included in the exchange, with each class or series constituting a
separate voting group; and

(iii)  On a plan of merger or share exchange, if the voting group is
entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a voting group
to approve a plan of merger or share exchange.

(g)  Unless the articles of incorporation otherwise provide, approval by
the corporation's shareholders of a plan of merger or share exchange is
not required if:

(i)  The corporation will survive the merger or is the acquiring
corporation in a share exchange;

(ii)  Except for amendments permitted by W.S. 17‑16‑1005, its articles
of incorporation will not be changed;

(iii)  Each shareholder of the corporation whose shares were outstanding
immediately before the effective date of the merger or share exchange
will hold the same number of shares, with identical preferences,
limitations, and relative rights, immediately after the effective date
of change; and

(iv)  The issuance in the merger or share exchange of shares or other
securities convertible into or rights exercisable for shares does not
require a vote under W.S. 17‑16‑621(f).

(h)  If as a result of a merger or share exchange one (1) or more
shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to owner
liability for the debts, obligations or liabilities of any other person
or entity, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange shall
require the execution, by each shareholder of the domestic corporation,
of a separate written consent to become subject to owner liability.

(j)  After a merger or share exchange is authorized, and at any time
before articles of merger or share exchange are filed, the planned
merger or share exchange may be abandoned, subject to any contractual
rights, without further shareholder action, in accordance with the
procedure set forth in the plan of merger or share exchange or, if none
is set forth, in the manner determined by the board of directors.

17‑16‑1105.  Merger between parent and subsidiary or between
subsidiaries.

(a)  A domestic parent corporation that owns shares of a domestic or
foreign subsidiary corporation that carry at least eighty percent (80%)
of the voting power of each class and series of the outstanding shares
of a subsidiary that have voting power may merge the subsidiary into
itself or into another such subsidiary, or merge itself into the
subsidiary, without approval of the board of directors or shareholders
of the subsidiary, unless the articles of incorporation of any of the
corporations otherwise provide, and unless, in the case of a foreign
subsidiary, approval by the subsidiary's board of directors or
shareholders is required by the laws under which the subsidiary is
organized.

(b)  If under subsection (a) of this section approval of a merger by the
subsidiary's shareholders is not required, the parent corporation shall,
within ten (10) days after the effective date of the merger, notify each
of the subsidiary's shareholders that the merger has become effective.

(c)  Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a
merger between a parent and a subsidiary shall be governed by the
provisions of this article applicable to mergers generally.

of Wyoming law.

ARTICLE 12

SALE OF ASSETS

17‑16‑1201.  Disposition of assets not requiring shareholder approval.

(a)  No approval of the shareholders of a corporation is required unless
the articles of incorporation otherwise provide:

(i)  To sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any or all of the
corporation's assets in the usual and regular course of business;

(ii)  To mortgage, pledge, dedicate to the repayment of indebtedness,
whether with or without recourse, or otherwise encumber any or all of
the corporation's assets whether or not in the usual and regular course
of business; or

(iii)  To transfer any or all of the corporation's assets to one (1) or
more corporations or other entities all of the shares or interests of
which are owned by the corporation; or

(iv)  To distribute assets pro rata to the holders of one (1) or more
classes or series of the corporation's shares.

(b)  Repealed by Laws 2009, Ch. 115, § 3.

17‑16‑1202.  Shareholder approval of certain dispositions.

(a)  A sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of assets, other than
a disposition described in W.S. 17‑16‑1201, requires approval of the
corporation's shareholders if the disposition would leave the
corporation without a significant continuing business activity. If a
significant business activity of the corporation prior to any such
disposition of assets was the active or passive holding, maintenance or
management of investments, then such holding, maintenance or management
of investments shall be considered a significant continuing business
activity. If a corporation retains a business activity that represented
at least twenty-five percent (25%) of total assets at the end of the
most recently completed fiscal year, and twenty-five percent (25%) of
either income from continuing operations before taxes or revenues from
continuing operations for that fiscal year, in each case of the
corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, the
corporation will conclusively be deemed to have retained a significant
continuing business activity.

(b)  A disposition that requires approval of the shareholders under
subsection (a) of this section shall be initiated by a resolution by the
board of directors authorizing the disposition. After adoption of such a
resolution, the board of directors shall submit the proposed disposition
to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors shall
also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders
approve the proposed disposition, unless the board of directors makes a
determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special
circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case
the board of directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for
that determination.

(c)  The board of directors may condition its submission of a
disposition to the shareholders under subsection (b) of this section on
any basis.

(d)  If a disposition is required to be approved by the shareholders
under subsection (a) of this section and if the approval is to be given
at a meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or
not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the
disposition is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that
the purpose, or one (1) of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider
the disposition and shall contain a description of the disposition,
including the terms and conditions thereof and the consideration to be
received by the corporation.

(e)  Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors,
acting pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, require a greater
vote or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of a
disposition by the shareholders shall require the approval of the
shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum exists.

(f)  After a disposition has been approved by the shareholders under
subsection (b) of this section and at any time before the disposition
has been consummated, it may be abandoned by the corporation without
action by the shareholders, subject to any contractual rights of other
parties to the disposition.

(g)  A disposition of assets in the course of dissolution under article
14 is not governed by this section.

(h)  For purposes of this section, the ownership interests of a parent
corporation in its subsidiaries, whether owned directly by the parent
corporation or indirectly through other subsidiaries shall be valued at
the net asset values of such subsidiaries, without application of any
discount to the valuation of such ownership interests because of a lack
of marketability or otherwise.

becomes effective, the corporation shall deliver a written appraisal
notice to all shareholders who satisfied the requirements of W.S.
17‑16‑1321(a) or (b). In the case of a merger under W.S. 17‑16‑1105, the

(b)  The appraisal notice shall be sent no later than ten (10) days
after the corporate action specified in W.S. 17‑16‑1302(a) became
effective, and shall:

(i)  Supply a form that:

17‑16‑1323.  Perfection of rights; right to withdraw.

(a)  A shareholder who receives notice pursuant to W.S. 17‑16‑1322 and
who wishes to exercise appraisal rights shall sign and return the form
sent by the corporation and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit
his certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the date
referred to in the notice pursuant to W.S. 17‑16‑1322(b)(ii)(B). In
addition, if applicable, the shareholder shall certify on the form
whether the beneficial owner of such shares acquired beneficial
ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth in the
notice pursuant to W.S. 17‑16‑1322(b)(i). If a shareholder fails to make
this certification, the corporation may elect to treat the shareholder's
shares as after acquired shares under W.S. 17‑16‑1324. Once a
shareholder deposits that shareholder's certificates or, in the case of
uncertificated shares, returns the signed forms, that shareholder loses
all rights as a shareholder, unless the shareholder withdraws pursuant
to subsection (b) of this section.

(b)  The shareholder who has complied with subsection (a) of this
section may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and
withdraw from the appraisal process by so notifying the corporation in
writing by the date set forth in the appraisal notice pursuant to W.S.
17‑16‑1322(b)(ii)(E). A shareholder who fails to so withdraw from the
appraisal process may not thereafter withdraw without the corporation's
written consent.

(c)  A shareholder who does not sign and return the form and, in the
case of certificated shares, deposit his share certificates where
required, each by the date set forth in the notice described in W.S.
17‑16‑1322(b), is not entitled to payment under this article.

17‑16‑1324.  Payment.

(a)  Except as provided in W.S. 17‑16‑1325, within one hundred twenty
(120) days after the form required by W.S. 17‑16‑1322(b)(ii)(B) is due,
the corporation shall pay in cash or other agreed upon consideration to
those shareholders who complied with W.S. 17‑16‑1323 the amount the
corporation estimates to be the fair value of his shares, plus interest.

(b)  The payment to each shareholder pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section shall be accompanied by:

(i)  The annual financial statements specified in W.S. 17‑16‑1620(a) of
the corporation that issued the shares to be appraised, which shall be
of a date ending not more than sixteen (16) months before the date of
payment and shall comply with W.S. 17‑16‑1620(b), provided that if such
annual financial statements are not reasonably available, the
corporation shall provide reasonably equivalent financial information.
The corporation shall also provide the latest available quarterly
financial statements, if any;

(ii)  A statement of the corporation's estimate of the fair value of the
shares which estimate shall equal or exceed the corporation's estimate
given pursuant to W.S. 17‑16‑1322(b)(ii)(C);

(iii)  A statement that shareholders described in subsection (a) of this
section have the right to demand further payment under W.S. 17‑16‑1326
and that if any shareholder does not do so within the time period
specified therein, the shareholder shall be deemed to have accepted such
payment in full satisfaction of the corporation's obligations under this
article.

17‑16‑1325.  After-acquired shares.

(a)  A corporation may elect to withhold payment required by W.S.
17‑16‑1324 from any shareholder who was required to, but did not certify
that beneficial ownership of all of the shareholder's shares for which
appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before the date set forth in
the appraisal notice sent pursuant to W.S. 17‑16‑1322(b)(i).

(b)  If the corporation elected to withhold payment under subsection (a)
of this section, it shall, within thirty (30) days after the form
required by W.S. 17‑16‑1322(b)(ii)(B) is due, notify all shareholders
described in subsection (a) of this section:

(i)  Of the information required by W.S. 17‑16‑1324(b)(i);

(ii)  Of the corporation's estimate of fair value pursuant to W.S.
17‑16‑1324(b)(ii);

(iii)  That they may accept the corporation's estimate of fair value,
plus interest, in full satisfaction of their demands or demand appraisal
under W.S. 17‑16‑1326;

(iv)  That those shareholders who wish to accept the offer shall so
notify the corporation of their acceptance of the corporation's offer
within thirty (30) days after receiving the offer; and

(v)  That those shareholders who do not satisfy the requirements for
demanding appraisal under W.S. 17‑16‑1326 shall be deemed to have
accepted the corporation's offer.

(c)  Within ten (10) days after receiving the shareholder's acceptance
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the corporation shall pay in
cash or other agreed upon consideration the amount it offered under
paragraph (b)(ii) of this section to each shareholder who agreed to
accept the corporation's offer in full satisfaction of the shareholder's
demand.

(d)  Within one hundred thirty (130) days after sending the notice
described in subsection (b) of this section, the corporation shall pay
in cash the amount it offered to pay under paragraph (b)(ii) of this
section to each shareholder described in paragraph (b)(v) of this
section.

17‑16‑1326.  Procedure if shareholder dissatisfied with payment or
offer.

(a)  A shareholder paid pursuant to W.S. 17‑16‑1324 who is dissatisfied
with the amount of the payment may notify the corporation in writing of
that shareholder's estimate of the fair value of his shares and demand
payment of his estimate plus interest, less any payment under W.S.
17‑16‑1324. A shareholder offered payment under W.S. 17‑16‑1325 who is
dissatisfied with that offer shall reject the offer and demand payment
of the shareholder's stated estimate of the fair value of the shares
plus interest.

(b)  A shareholder who fails to notify the corporation in writing of
that shareholder's demand to be paid the shareholder's stated estimate
of the fair value plus interest under subsection (a) of this section
within thirty (30) days after receiving the corporation's payment or
offer of payment under W.S. 17‑16‑1324 or 17‑16‑1325, respectively,
waives the right to demand payment under this section and shall be
entitled only to the payment made or offered pursuant to those
respective sections.

17‑16‑1330.  Court action.

(a)  If a shareholder makes a demand for payment under W.S. 17‑16‑1326
which remains unsettled, the corporation shall commence a proceeding
within sixty (60) days after receiving the payment demand and petition
the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued
interest. If the corporation does not commence the proceeding within the
sixty (60) day period, it shall pay each shareholder demanding appraisal
rights whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded pursuant to
W.S. 17‑16‑1326 plus interest.

(b)  The corporation shall commence the proceeding in the district court
of the county where a corporation's principal office, or if none in this
state, its registered office, is located. If the corporation is a
foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, it shall
commence the proceeding in the county in this state where the principal
office or registered office of the domestic corporation merged with or
whose shares were acquired by the foreign corporation was located at the
time of the transaction.

(c)  The corporation shall make all shareholders, whether or not
residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled parties to the
proceeding as in an action against their shares and all parties shall be
served with a copy of the petition. Nonresidents may be served by
registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.

(d)  The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced
under subsection (b) of this section is plenary and exclusive. The court
may appoint one (1) or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence
and recommend decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers
have the powers described in the order appointing them, or in the
amendment to it. The shareholders demanding appraisal rights are
entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil
proceedings.

(e)  Each shareholder made a party to the proceeding is entitled to
judgment for:

(i)  The amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of his
shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation to the
shareholder for those shares; or

(ii)  The fair value, plus accrued interest, of his after-acquired
shares for which the corporation elected to withhold payment under W.S.
17‑16‑1325.

17‑16‑1331.  Court costs and counsel fees.

(a)  The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under W.S.
17‑16‑1330 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the
reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the
court. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except
that the court may assess costs against all or some of the shareholders
demanding appraisal, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent
the court finds the shareholders demanding appraisal rights acted
arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the
rights provided by this article.

(b)  The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts
the court finds equitable:

(i)  Against the corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders
demanding appraisal if the court finds the corporation did not
substantially comply with the requirements of W.S. 17‑16‑1320 through
17‑16‑1326; or

(ii)  Against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding
appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the
party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily,
vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by
this article.

(c)  If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the services of
counsel and any other expenses incurred for any shareholder demanding
appraisal were of substantial benefit to other shareholders similarly
situated, and that the fees for those services and other expenses should
not be assessed against the corporation, the court may direct that those
fees and expenses be paid out of the amounts awarded the shareholders
who were benefited.

(d)  To the extent the corporation fails to make a required payment
pursuant to W.S. 17‑16‑1324, 17‑16‑1325 or 17‑16‑1326, the shareholder
may sue directly for the amount owed, and to the extent successful,
shall be entitled to recover from the corporation all expenses of the
suit.

17‑16‑1340.  Other remedies limited.

(a)  The legality of a proposed or completed corporate action described
in W.S. 17‑16‑1302(a) may not be contested, nor may the corporate action
be enjoined, set aside or rescinded, in a legal or equitable proceeding
by a shareholder after the shareholders have approved the corporate
action.

(b)  Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a corporate action
that:

(i)  Was not authorized and approved in accordance with the applicable
provisions of:

(A)  Article 9, 10, 11 or 12 of this act;

light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;

(iii)  Reserved;

corporate action was not effective at least ten (10) days before the
corporate action was effected; and

17‑16‑1421.  Procedure for and effect of administrative dissolution.

(a)  If the secretary of state determines that one (1) or more grounds
exist under W.S. 17‑16‑1420 for dissolving a corporation, he shall serve
the corporation with written notice of his determination under W.S.
17‑28‑104, except for W.S. 17‑16‑1420(a)(v) in which case dissolution is
by choice and therefore automatic.

(b)  If the corporation does not correct each ground for dissolution or
demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the secretary of state
that each ground determined by the secretary of state does not exist
within sixty (60) days after service of the notice is perfected under
W.S. 17‑28‑104, the secretary of state shall administratively dissolve
the corporation by signing, either manually or in facsimile, a

dissolution and its effective date. The secretary of state shall file
the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the corporation
under W.S. 17‑28‑104.

corporation was administratively dissolved under W.S. 17‑16‑1421 may
apply to the secretary of state for reinstatement within two (2) years
after the effective date of dissolution. Reinstatement may be denied by
the secretary of state if the corporation has been the subject of
secretary of state and law enforcement investigation pertaining to fraud

reason to believe the corporation was engaged in illegal operations. The
application shall:

(i)  Recite the name of the corporation and the effective date of its
administrative dissolution;

exist or have been eliminated;

maintain a registered agent, include payment of a two hundred fifty
dollar (\$250.00) reinstatement fee and payment of any fees and taxes
then delinquent.

the information required by subsection (a) of this section and that the

and prepare a certificate of reinstatement that recites his
determination and the effective date of reinstatement, file the original
of the certificate, and serve a copy on the corporation under W.S.
17‑28‑104.

(c)  When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes
effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and
the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the
administrative dissolution had never occurred.

(d)  The corporation shall retain its registered corporate name during
the two (2) year reinstatement period.

(e)  A person who files any document under this section without proper
corporate authority to do so is in violation of W.S. 6‑5‑308.

17‑16‑1423.  Appeal from denial of reinstatement.

(a)  If the secretary of state denies a corporation's application for
reinstatement following administrative dissolution, he shall serve the
corporation under W.S. 17‑28‑104 with a written notice that explains the
reason or reasons for denial.

(b)  The corporation may appeal the denial of reinstatement to the
district court within thirty (30) days after service of the notice of
denial is perfected. The corporation appeals by petitioning the court to

secretary of state's certificate of dissolution, the corporation's
application for reinstatement, and the secretary of state's notice of
denial.

(c)  The court may summarily order the secretary of state to reinstate
the dissolved corporation or may take other action the court considers

deadlock;

(B)  The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted,
are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or

(c)  Reserved.

17‑16‑1431.  Procedure for judicial dissolution.

(a)  Venue for a proceeding by the attorney general to dissolve a
corporation lies in Laramie county district court. Venue for a

the county where a corporation's principal office, or, if none in this
state, its registered office, is or was last located.

(b)  It is not necessary to make shareholders parties to a proceeding to
dissolve a corporation unless relief is sought against them
individually.

preserve the corporate assets wherever located, and carry on the
business of the corporation until a full hearing can be held.

(d)  Within ten (10) days of the commencement of a proceeding under W.S.
17‑16‑1430(a)(ii) to dissolve a corporation that has no shares listed on
a national securities exchange or regularly traded in a market
maintained by one (1) or more members of a national or affiliated
securities association, the corporation must send to all shareholders,
other than the petitioner, a notice stating that the shareholders are
entitled to avoid the dissolution of the corporation by electing to
purchase the petitioner's shares under W.S. 17‑16‑1434 and accompanied
by a copy of W.S. 17‑16‑1434.

17‑16‑1432.  Receivership or custodianship.

(a)  A court in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a corporation
may appoint one (1) or more receivers to wind up and liquidate, or one
(1) or more custodians to manage, the business and affairs of the
corporation. The court shall hold a hearing, after notifying all parties

before appointing a receiver or custodian. The court appointing a
receiver or custodian has exclusive jurisdiction over the corporation
and all of its property wherever located.

(b)  The court may appoint an individual or a domestic or foreign
corporation authorized to transact business in this state as a receiver
or custodian. The court may require the receiver or custodian to post
bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs.

custodian in its appointing order, which may be amended from time to

through or in place of its board of directors or officers, to the extent
necessary to manage the affairs of the corporation in the best interests
of its shareholders and creditors.

custodian, and during a custodianship may redesignate the custodian a
receiver, if doing so is in the best interests of the corporation, its
shareholders and creditors.

(e)  The court from time to time during the receivership or
custodianship may order compensation paid and expense disbursements or
reimbursements made to the receiver or custodian and his counsel from
the assets of the corporation or proceeds from the sale of the assets.

17‑16‑1433.  Decree of dissolution.

(a)  If after a hearing the court determines that one (1) or more
grounds for judicial dissolution described in W.S. 17‑16‑1430 exist, it
may enter a decree dissolving the corporation and specifying the
effective date of the dissolution, and the clerk of the court shall
deliver a certified copy of the decree to the secretary of state, who
shall file it.

(b)  After entering the decree of dissolution, the court shall direct
the winding up and liquidation of the corporation's business and affairs
in accordance with W.S. 17‑16‑1405 and the notification of claimants in
accordance with W.S. 17‑16‑1406 and 17‑16‑1407.

17‑16‑1434.  Election to purchase in lieu of dissolution.

(a)  In a proceeding under W.S. 17‑16‑1430(a)(ii) to dissolve a
corporation that has no shares listed on a national securities exchange
or regularly traded in a market maintained by one (1) or more members of
a national or affiliated securities association, the corporation may
elect or, if it fails to elect, one (1) or more shareholders may elect
to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning shareholder at the fair
value of the shares. An election pursuant to this section shall be
irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set
aside or modify the election.

(b)  An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with
the court at any time within ninety (90) days after the filing of the
petition under W.S. 17‑16‑1430(a)(ii) or at such later time as the court
in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one
(1) or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within ten (10) days
thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the
petitioner. The notice must state the name and number of shares owned by
the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing
shareholder and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the
election to purchase shares in accordance with this section.
Shareholders who wish to participate must file notice of their intention
to join in the purchase no later than thirty (30) days after the
effective date of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an
election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to
purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall purchase in
proportion to their ownership of shares as of the date the first
election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise
directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one (1)
or more shareholders, the proceeding under W.S. 17‑16‑1430(a)(ii) may
not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell
or otherwise dispose of his shares, unless the court determines that it
would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than
the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale or other
disposition.

(c)  If, within sixty (60) days of the filing of the first election, the
parties reach agreement as to the fair value in terms of purchase of the
petitioner's shares, the court shall enter an order directing the
purchase of petitioner's shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to
by the parties.

(d)  If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in
subsection (c) of this section, the court, upon application of any
party, shall stay the W.S. 17‑16‑1430(a)(ii) proceedings and determine
the fair value of the petitioner's shares as of the day before the date
on which the petition under W.S. 17‑16‑1430(a)(ii) was filed or as of
such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.

(e)  Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall
enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as
the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase
price in installments, where necessary in the interest of equity,
provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any
additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if
the shares are to be purchased by the shareholders, the allocation of
shares among them. In allocating petitioner's shares among holders of
different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the
existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different
classes insofar as practicable and may direct that the holders of a
specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase.
Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the
court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the
petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or
otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. If the court
finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief
under W.S. 17‑16‑1430(a)(ii)(B) or (D), it may award to the petitioning
shareholder reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of any experts
employed by him.

(f)  Upon entry of an order under subsection (c) or (e) of this section,
the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under
W.S. 17‑16‑1430, and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have
any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the
right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court
which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.

(g)  The purchase order pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall
be made within ten (10) days after the date the order becomes final
unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of
its intention to adopt articles of dissolution pursuant to W.S.
17‑16‑1402 and 17‑16‑1403, which articles must then be adopted and filed
within fifty (50) days thereafter. Upon filing of such articles of
dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with
provisions of W.S. 17‑16‑1405 through 17‑16‑1407, and the order entered
pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall no longer be of any
force or effect, except that the court may award the petitioning
shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with the
provisions of the last sentence of subsection (e) of this section and
the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on
behalf of the corporation.

(h)  Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under
subsection (c) or (e) of this section, other than an award of fees and
expenses pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, is subject to the
provisions of W.S. 17‑16‑640.

17‑16‑1440.  Deposit with state treasurer.

Assets of a dissolved corporation that should be transferred to a
creditor, claimant or shareholder of the corporation who cannot be found
or who is not competent to receive them shall be reduced to cash and
deposited with the state treasurer for safekeeping. When the creditor,
claimant or shareholder furnishes satisfactory proof of entitlement to
the amount deposited, the state treasurer shall pay him or his
representative that amount.

corporation shall be subject to the penalty for transacting business
without authority as set forth in W.S. 17‑16‑1502(d).

the board of directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for
that determination. The board of directors may condition its submission
of the resolution to the shareholders on any basis. If the approval of
the shareholders is to be given at a meeting, the corporation shall

of shareholders at which the resolution for transfer is to be submitted

of the foreign jurisdiction in order for the corporation to be accepted
in that jurisdiction, provided that the corporation may not misrepresent
the requirements or effects of the provisions of this section.

ARTICLE 18

DOMESTICATION AND CONTINUANCE OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS; TRANSFER OF
DOMESTIC CORPORATIONS

17‑16‑1801.  Domestication of foreign corporations.

Any corporation incorporated under the laws of any of the several states
of the United States for any purpose except acting as an insurer as
defined in W.S. 26‑1‑102(a)(xvi), or acting as a financial institution
as described by W.S. 13‑1‑101(a)(ix) may become a domestic corporation
of this state by delivering or causing to be delivered to the secretary
of state articles of domestication. Upon filing the articles of
domestication, the secretary of state shall issue to the foreign
corporation a certificate of domestication which shall continue the
corporation as if it had been incorporated under this act. The articles
of domestication, upon being filed by the secretary of state, constitute
the articles of the domesticated foreign corporation and it shall
thereafter have all the powers and privileges and be subjected to all
the duties and limitations granted and imposed upon domestic
corporations under the provisions of the Wyoming Business Corporation
Act. A corporation does not become a resident for the purpose of W.S.
16‑6‑101 through 16‑6‑118 solely because it becomes a domestic
corporation under this section.

17‑16‑1802.  Application for certificate of domestication; articles of
domestication.

(a)  A foreign corporation, in order to procure a certificate of
domestication shall file articles of domestication with the secretary of
state, which articles shall include and set forth:

authorization, and a certificate of good standing not more than thirty

which it is incorporated;

(iii)  The date of incorporation and the period of duration of the
corporation;

pursue in the transaction of business in this state;

(vii)  The names and addresses of the directors and officers of the
corporation;

units which the corporation has authority to issue, itemized by classes,
par value of shares, shares without par value and series, if any, within
a class;

(ix)  A statement of the aggregate number of issued shares or other
ownership units itemized by classes, par value of shares, shares without
par value and series, if any, within a class;

(x)  A statement that the corporation accepts the constitution of this
state in compliance with the requirement of article 10, section 5 of the
Wyoming constitution;

(xi)  Any additional information as may be necessary or appropriate to
enable the secretary of state to determine whether the corporation is
entitled to a certificate of domestication evidencing its authority to
transact business in this state, and to determine and assess the fees
and license taxes under the laws of this state.

17‑16‑1810.  Continuance of foreign corporations.

(a)  Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any corporation
incorporated for any purpose except acting as an insurer as defined in
W.S. 26‑1‑102(a)(xvi), or acting as a financial institution as described
by W.S. 13‑1‑101(a)(ix) under the laws of any jurisdiction other than
this state may, if the jurisdiction will acknowledge the corporation's
termination of domicile in the foreign jurisdiction, apply to the
secretary of state for registration under this act, thus continuing the
foreign corporation in Wyoming as if it had been incorporated in this
state. The secretary of state may issue a certificate of registration
upon receipt of an application supported by articles of continuance as
provided by this act together with the statements, information and
documents set out in subsection (c) of this section. The certificate of
registration may then be issued subject to any limitations and
conditions and may contain any provisions as may appear proper to the
secretary of state.

(b)  The secretary of state shall cause notice of issuance of a
certificate of registration to be given forthwith to the proper officer
of the jurisdiction in which the corporation was previously
incorporated.

(c)  The articles of continuance filed by a foreign corporation with the
secretary of state shall contain:

(i)  A certified copy of its original articles of incorporation and all
amendments thereto or its equivalent basic corporate charter or other
authorization;

(ii)  The name of the corporation and the jurisdiction under the laws of
which it is incorporated;

(iii)  The date of incorporation and the period of duration of the
corporation;

(iv)  The address of the principal office of the corporation;

(v)  The address of the proposed registered office of the corporation in
this state and the name of its proposed registered agent in this state
at the address;

officers of the corporation;

(viii)  A statement of the aggregate number of shares or other ownership
units which the corporation has authority to issue, itemized by classes,
par value of shares, shares without par value and series, if any, within
a class;

(ix)  A statement of the aggregate number of issued shares or other
ownership units itemized by classes, par value of shares, shares without
par value and series, if any, within a class;

(x)  Such additional information concerning capital structure or
financial status as the secretary of state deems necessary to establish
fees;

(xi)  A statement that the corporation accepts the constitution of this
state in compliance with the requirements of article 10, section 5 of
the Wyoming constitution;

(xii)  Any additional information necessary or appropriate to enable the
secretary of state to determine whether the corporation is entitled to a
certificate of registration evidencing its authority to transact
business in the state and to determine and to assess any fees and taxes
under the laws of this state;

(xiii)  Any additional information permitted in articles of
incorporation under W.S. 17‑16‑202.

(d)  The application shall be executed by the corporation by its
president or other officer, director, trustee, manager or person
performing functions equivalent to those of a president and who is
authorized to execute the application on behalf of the corporation and
shall be verified by the officer signing the application.

(e)  The provisions of the articles of continuance may, without
expressly so stating, vary from the provisions of the corporation's
articles of incorporation or equivalent basic corporate charter or other
authorization, if the variation is one which a corporation incorporated
under the Wyoming Business Corporation Act could effect by way of
amendment to its articles of incorporation. Upon issuance of a
certificate of continuance by the secretary of state, the articles of
continuance shall be deemed to be the articles of incorporation of the
continued corporation. The corporation may elect to incorporate by
reference in the articles of continuance its basic corporate charter or
other authorization which had been adopted by the corporation in the
foreign jurisdiction, in order to permit the same to continue to act as
the articles of incorporation of the corporation, provided, however,
that such basic corporate charter or other authorization shall be deemed
amended to the extent necessary to make the same conform to the laws of
Wyoming and to the provisions of the articles of continuance.

(f)  Except for the purpose of W.S. 16‑6‑101 through 16‑6‑118, the
existence of any corporation heretofore or hereafter issued a
certificate of continuation under this act shall be deemed to have
commenced on the date the corporation commenced its existence in the
jurisdiction in which the corporation was first formed, incorporated or
otherwise came into being. The laws of Wyoming shall apply to a
corporation continuing under this act to the same extent as if the
corporation had been incorporated under the laws of Wyoming from and
after the issuance of a certificate of continuation under this act by
the secretary of state to the corporation. When a foreign corporation is
continued as a corporation under this act, such continuance shall not
affect the corporation's ownership of its property or liability for any
existing obligations, causes of action, claims, pending or threatened
prosecutions or civil or administrative actions, convictions, rulings,
orders, judgments, or any other characteristics or aspects of the
corporation and its existence.

(g)  A share of stock of a foreign corporation issued before the
corporation's continuance in Wyoming is deemed to have been issued in
compliance with the Wyoming Business Corporation Act and the provisions
of the articles of continuance, irrespective of whether the share is
fully paid and nonassessable, and irrespective of any designation,
rights, privileges, restrictions or conditions set out on or referred to
in the certificate representing the share, and irrespective of whether
the certificate is in registered or bearer form. Continuance under this
act does not deprive a stockholder of any right or privilege that he
claims under, or relieve the stockholder of any liability in respect of,
an issued share.

(h)  As used in this section, the term "corporation" shall include any
incorporated organization, foundation, trust, association, or similar
entity which appears to the secretary of state to possess
characteristics sufficiently similar to those of a corporation organized
under the Wyoming Business Corporation Act.

(j)  This act applies to all corporations continued in Wyoming on the
effective date of this act. The repeal of any statute or part thereof by
this act shall have such effect as is provided in W.S. 17‑16‑1703.

CHAPTER 17

CLOSE CORPORATION SUPPLEMENT

ARTICLE 1

PROVISIONS

17‑17‑101.  Short title.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Wyoming Statutory

17‑17‑102.  Application of Wyoming Business Corporation Act and the
provisions of W.S. 17‑3‑101 through 17‑3‑104.

(a)  The Wyoming Business Corporation Act applies to statutory close
corporations to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this
chapter.

(b)  This chapter applies to a professional corporation organized under
W.S. 17‑3‑101 through 17‑3‑104 whose articles of incorporation contain
the statement required by W.S. 17‑17‑103(a), except insofar as W.S.
17‑3‑101 through 17‑3‑104 contain inconsistent provisions.

(c)  This chapter does not repeal or modify any statute or rule of law
that is or would apply to a corporation that is organized under the
Wyoming Business Corporation Act and the provisions of W.S. 17‑3‑101
through 17‑3‑104 and that does not elect to become a statutory close
corporation under W.S. 17‑17‑103.

17‑17‑103.  Definition and election of statutory close corporation
status.

(a)  A statutory close corporation is a corporation whose articles of
incorporation contain a statement that the corporation is a statutory
close corporation.

(b)  A corporation having thirty‑five (35) or fewer shareholders may
become a statutory close corporation by amending its articles of
incorporation to include the statement required by subsection (a) of
this section. For corporations formed prior to January 1, 1990, the
amendment shall be approved by all of the holders of the votes of each
class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not otherwise
entitled to vote on amendments. For corporations formed on or after
January 1, 1990, the amendment must be approved by the holders of at
least two‑thirds (2/3) of the votes of each class or series of shares of
the corporation, voting as separate voting groups, whether or not
otherwise entitled to vote on amendments. If the amendment is adopted, a
shareholder who voted against the amendment is entitled to assert
dissenters' rights under W.S. 17‑16‑1301 through 17‑16‑1331.

17‑17‑110.  Notice of statutory close corporations status on issued
shares.

(a)  The following statement must appear conspicuously on each share
certificate issued by a statutory close corporation:

The rights of shareholders in a statutory close corporation may differ
materially from the rights of shareholders in other corporations. Copies
of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, shareholders' agreements,
and other documents, any of which may restrict transfers and affect
voting and other rights, may be obtained by a shareholder on written
request to the corporation.

(b)  Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of
uncertificated shares, the corporation shall send to the shareholders a
written notice containing the information required by subsection (a) of
this section.

(c)  The notice required by this section satisfies all requirements of
this chapter and of W.S. 17‑16‑627 that notice of share transfer
restrictions be given.

(d)  A person claiming an interest in shares of a statutory close
corporation which has complied with the notice requirement of this
section is bound by the documents referred to in the notice. A person
claiming an interest in shares of a statutory close corporation which
has not complied with the notice requirement of this section is bound by
any documents of which he, or a person through whom he claims, has
knowledge or notice.

(e)  A corporation shall provide to any shareholder upon his written
request and without charge copies of provisions that restrict transfer
or affect voting or other rights of shareholders appearing in articles
of incorporation, bylaws, or shareholders' or voting trust agreements
filed with the corporation.

17‑17‑111.  Share transfer prohibition.

(a)  An interest in shares of a statutory close corporation may not be
voluntarily or involuntarily transferred, by operation of law or
otherwise, except to the extent permitted by the articles of
incorporation or under W.S. 17‑17‑112 or pursuant to a buy‑sell
agreement entered into by all the shareholders.

(b)  Except to the extent the articles of incorporation provide
otherwise, this section does not apply to a transfer:

(i)  To the corporation or to any other holder of the same class or
series of shares;

(ii)  To members of the shareholder's immediate family, or to a trust,
all of whose beneficiaries are members of the shareholder's immediate
family, which immediate family consists of his spouse, parents, lineal
descendants, including adopted children and stepchildren, and the spouse
of any lineal descendant, and brothers and sisters;

(iii)  That has been approved in writing by all of the holders of the
corporation's shares having general voting rights;

(iv)  To a personal representative upon the death of a shareholder or to
a trustee or receiver as the result of a bankruptcy, insolvency,
dissolution or similar proceeding brought by or against a shareholder;

(v)  By merger, consolidation or share exchange under W.S. 17‑16‑1101
through 17‑16‑1114, or an exchange of existing shares for other shares
of a different class or series in the corporation;

(vi)  By a pledge as collateral for a loan that does not grant the
pledgee any voting rights possessed by the pledgor; or

(vii)  Made after termination of the corporation's status as a statutory
close corporation.

17‑17‑112.  Share transfer after first refusal by corporation.

(a)  A person desiring to transfer shares of a statutory close
corporation subject to the transfer prohibition of W.S. 17‑17‑111 must
first offer them to the corporation by obtaining an offer to purchase
the shares for cash from a third person who is eligible to purchase the
shares under subsection (b) of this section. The offer by the third
person must be in writing and state the offeror's name and address, the
number and class, or series, of shares offered, the offering price per
share, and the other terms of the offer.

(b)  A third person is eligible to purchase the shares if:

(i)  He is eligible to become a qualified shareholder under any federal
or state tax statute the corporation has adopted and he agrees in
writing not to terminate his qualification without the approval of the
remaining shareholders; and

(ii)  His purchase of the shares will not impose a personal holding
company tax or similar federal or state penalty tax on the corporation.

(c)  The person desiring to transfer shares shall deliver the offer to
the corporation, and by doing so offers to sell the shares to the
corporation on the terms of the offer. Within twenty (20) days after the
corporation receives the offer, the corporation shall call a special
shareholders' meeting, to be held not more than forty (40) days after
the call, to decide whether the corporation should purchase all, but not
less than all, of the offered shares. The offer must be approved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of votes entitled to be
cast at the meeting, excluding votes in respect of the shares covered by
the offer.

(d)  The corporation must deliver to the offering shareholder written
notice of acceptance within seventy‑five (75) days after receiving the
offer or the offer is rejected. If the corporation makes a counteroffer,
the shareholder must deliver to the corporation written notice of
acceptance within fifteen (15) days after receiving the counteroffer or
the counteroffer is rejected. If the corporation accepts the original
offer or the shareholder accepts the corporation's counteroffer, the
shareholder shall deliver to the corporation duly endorsed certificates
for the shares, or instruct the corporation in writing to transfer the
shares if uncertificated, within twenty (20) days after the effective
date of the notice of acceptance. The corporation may specifically
enforce the shareholder's delivery or instruction obligation under this
subsection.

(e)  A corporation accepting an offer to purchase shares under this
section may allocate some or all of the shares to one (1) or more of its
shareholders or to other persons if all the shareholders voting in favor
of the purchase approve the allocation. If the corporation has more than
one (1) class or series of shares, however, the remaining holders of the
class or series of shares being purchased are entitled to a first option
to purchase the shares not purchased by the corporation in proportion to
their shareholdings or in some other proportion agreed to by all the
shareholders participating in the purchase.

(f)  If an offer to purchase shares under this section is rejected, the
offering shareholder, for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days
after the corporation received his offer, is entitled to transfer to the
third person offeror all, but not less than all, of the offered shares
in accordance with the terms of his offer to the corporation.

17‑17‑113.  Attempted share transfer in breach of prohibition.

(a)  An attempt to transfer shares in a statutory close corporation in
violation of a prohibition against transfer binding on the transferee is
ineffective.

(b)  An attempt to transfer shares in a statutory close corporation in
violation of a prohibition against transfer that is not binding on the
transferee, either because the notice required by W.S. 17‑17‑110 was not
given or because the prohibition is held unenforceable by a court, gives
the corporation an option to purchase the shares from the transferee for
the same price and on the same terms that he purchased them. To exercise
its option, the corporation must give the transferee written notice
within thirty (30) days after they are presented for registration in the
transferee's name. The corporation may specifically enforce the
transferee's sale obligation upon exercise of its purchase option.

17‑17‑114.  Compulsory purchase of shares after death of shareholder.

(a)  This section, and W.S. 17‑17‑115 through 17‑17‑117, apply to a
statutory close corporation only if so provided in its articles of
incorporation. If these sections apply, the personal representative of
the estate or the surviving joint tenant of a deceased shareholder may
require the corporation to purchase or cause to be purchased all, but
not less than all, of the decedent's shares or jointly owned shares or
to be dissolved.

(b)  The provisions of W.S. 17‑17‑115 through 17‑17‑117 may be modified
only if the modification is set forth or referred to in the articles of
incorporation.

(c)  An amendment to the articles of incorporation to provide for
application of W.S. 17‑17‑115 through 17‑17‑117, or to modify or delete
the provisions of these sections, must be approved by the holders of at
least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of each class or series of shares of
the statutory close corporation, voting as separate voting groups,
whether or not otherwise entitled to vote on amendments. If the
corporation has no shareholders when the amendment is proposed, it must
be approved by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the subscribers for shares,
if any, or, if none, by all of the incorporators.

(d)  A shareholder who votes against an amendment to modify or delete
the provisions of W.S. 17‑17‑115 through 17‑17‑117 is entitled to
dissenters' rights under W.S. 17‑16‑1301 through 17‑16‑1331 if the
amendment upon adoption terminates or substantially alters his existing
rights under these sections to have his shares purchased.

(e)  A shareholder may waive his and his estate's rights under W.S.
17‑17‑115 through 17‑17‑117 by a signed writing.

(f)  W.S. 17‑17‑115 through 17‑17‑117 do not prohibit any other
agreement providing for the purchase of shares upon a shareholder's
death, nor do they prevent a shareholder from enforcing any remedy he
has independent of these sections.

17‑17‑115.  Exercise of compulsory purchase right.

(a)  A person entitled and desiring to exercise the compulsory purchase
right described in W.S. 17‑17‑114 must deliver a written notice to the
corporation, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the death of the
shareholder, describing the number and class or series of shares
beneficially owned by the decedent and requesting that the corporation
offer to purchase the shares.

(b)  Within twenty (20) days after the effective date of the notice, the
corporation shall call a special shareholders' meeting, to be held not
more than forty (40) days after the call, to decide whether the
corporation should offer to purchase the shares. A purchase offer must
be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, excluding votes in respect of
the shares covered by the notice.

(c)  The corporation must deliver a purchase offer to the person
requesting it within seventy‑five (75) days after the effective date of
the request notice. A purchase offer must be accompanied by the
corporation's balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year ending not
more than sixteen (16) months before the effective date of the request
notice, an income statement for that year, a statement of changes in
shareholders' equity for that year, and the latest available interim
financial statements, if any. The person must accept the purchase offer
in writing within fifteen (15) days after receiving it or the offer is
rejected.

(d)  A corporation agreeing to purchase shares under this section may
allocate some or all of the shares to one (1) or more of its
shareholders or to other persons if all the shareholders voting in favor
of the purchase offer approve the allocation. If the corporation has
more than one (1) class or series of shares, however, the remaining
holders of the class or series of shares being purchased are entitled to
a first option to purchase the shares not purchased by the corporation
in proportion to their shareholdings or in some other proportion agreed
to by all the shareholders participating in the purchase.

(e)  If price and other terms of a compulsory purchase of shares are
fixed or are to be determined by the articles of incorporation, bylaws,
or a written agreement, the price and terms so fixed or determined
govern the compulsory purchase unless the purchaser defaults, in which
event the buyer is entitled to commence a proceeding for dissolution
under W.S. 17‑17‑116.

17‑17‑116.  Court action to compel purchase.

(a)  If an offer to purchase shares made under W.S. 17‑17‑115 is
rejected, or if no offer is made, the person exercising the compulsory
purchase right may commence a proceeding against the corporation to
compel the purchase in the district court of the county where the
corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its
registered office, is located. The corporation at its expense shall
notify in writing all of its shareholders, and any other person the
court directs, of the commencement of the proceeding. The jurisdiction
of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under this subsection
is plenary and exclusive.

(b)  The court shall determine the fair value of the shares subject to
compulsory purchase in accordance with the standards set forth in W.S.
17‑17‑142 together with terms for the purchase. Upon making these
determinations the court shall order the corporation to purchase or
cause the purchase of the shares or empower the person exercising the
compulsory purchase right to have the corporation dissolved.

(c)  After the purchase order is entered, the corporation may petition
the court to modify the terms of purchase and the court may do so if it
finds that changes in the financial or legal ability of the corporation
or other purchaser to complete the purchase justify a modification.

(d)  If the corporation or other purchaser does not make a payment
required by the court's order within thirty (30) days of its due date,
the seller may petition the court to dissolve the corporation and,
absent a showing of good cause for not making the payment, the court
shall do so.

(e)  A person making a payment to prevent or cure a default by the
corporation or other purchaser is entitled to recover the payment from
the defaulter.

17‑17‑117.  Court costs and other expenses.

(a)  The court in a proceeding commenced under W.S. 17‑17‑116 shall
determine the total costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable
compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court and of
counsel and experts employed by the parties. Except as provided in
subsection (b) of this section, the court shall assess these costs
equally against the corporation and the party exercising the compulsory
purchase right.

(b)  The court may assess all or a portion of the total costs of the
proceeding:

(i)  Against the person exercising the compulsory purchase right if the
court finds that the fair value of the shares does not substantially
exceed the corporation's last purchase offer made before commencement of
the proceeding and that the person's failure to accept the offer was
arbitrary, or otherwise not in good faith; or

(ii)  Against the corporation if the court finds that the fair value of
the shares substantially exceeds the corporation's last sale offer made
before commencement of the proceeding and that the offer was arbitrary,
or otherwise not made in good faith.

17‑17‑120.  Shareholder agreements.

(a)  All the shareholders of a statutory close corporation may agree in
writing to regulate the exercise of the corporate powers and the
management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the
relationship among the shareholders of the corporation.

(b)  An agreement authorized by this section is effective although:

(i)  It eliminates a board of directors;

(ii)  It restricts the discretion or powers of the board or authorizes
director proxies or weighted voting rights;

(iii)  Its effect is to treat the corporation as a partnership; or

(iv)  It creates a relationship among the shareholders or between the
shareholders and the corporation that would otherwise be appropriate
only among partners.

(c)  If the corporation has a board of directors, an agreement
authorized by this section restricting the discretion or powers of the
board relieves directors of liability imposed by law, and imposes that
liability on each person in whom the board's discretion or power is
vested, to the extent that the discretion or powers of the board of
directors are governed by the agreement.

(d)  A provision eliminating a board of directors in an agreement
authorized by this section is not effective unless the articles of
incorporation contain a statement to that effect as required by W.S.
17‑17‑121.

(e)  A provision entitling one (1) or more shareholders to dissolve the
corporation under W.S. 17‑17‑133 is effective only if a statement of
this right is contained in the articles of incorporation.

(f)  To amend an agreement authorized by this section, all the
shareholders must approve the amendment in writing unless the agreement
provides otherwise.

(g)  Subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an
agreement authorized by this section if shares are not issued when the
agreement was made.

(h)  This section does not prohibit any other agreement between or among
shareholders in a statutory close corporation.

17‑17‑121.  Elimination of board of directors.

(a)  A statutory close corporation may operate without a board of
directors if its articles of incorporation contain a statement to that
effect.

(b)  An amendment to articles of incorporation eliminating a board of
directors must be approved by all the shareholders of the corporation,
whether or not otherwise entitled to vote on amendments, or if no shares
have been issued, by all the subscribers for shares, if any, or if none,
by all the incorporators.

(c)  While a corporation is operating without a board of directors as
authorized by subsection (a) of this section:

(i)  All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority
of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the
direction of, the shareholders;

(ii)  Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise:

(A)  Action requiring director approval or both director and shareholder
approval is authorized if approved by the shareholders; and

(B)  Action requiring a majority or greater percentage vote of the board
of directors is authorized if approved by the majority or greater
percentage of the votes of shareholders entitled to vote on the action.

(iii)  A shareholder is not liable for his act or omission, although a
director would be, unless the shareholder was entitled to vote on the
action;

(iv)  A requirement by a state or the United States that a document
delivered for filing contain a statement that specified action has been
taken by the board of directors is satisfied by a statement that the
corporation is a statutory close corporation without a board of
directors and that the action was approved by the shareholders; and

(v)  The shareholders by resolution may appoint one (1) or more
shareholders to sign documents as "designated directors."

(d)  An amendment to articles of incorporation deleting the statement
eliminating a board of directors must be approved by the holders of at
least two‑thirds (2/3) of the votes of each class or series of shares of
the corporation, voting as separate voting groups, whether or not
otherwise entitled to vote on amendments. The amendment must also
specify the number, names and addresses of the corporation's directors
or describe who will perform the duties of a board under W.S. 17‑16‑801.

17‑17‑122.  Bylaws.

(a)  A statutory close corporation need not adopt bylaws if provisions
required by law to be contained in bylaws are contained in either the
articles of incorporation or a shareholder agreement authorized by W.S.
17‑17‑120.

(b)  If a corporation does not have bylaws when its statutory close
corporation status terminates under W.S. 17‑17‑131, the corporation
shall immediately adopt bylaws under W.S. 17‑16‑206.

17‑17‑123.  Annual meeting.

(a)  The annual meeting date for a statutory close corporation is the
last business day of the third month following the close of the business
year unless its articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a shareholder
agreement authorized by W.S. 17‑17‑120 fixes a different date.

(b)  A statutory close corporation need not hold an annual meeting
unless one (1) or more shareholders deliver written notice to the
corporation requesting a meeting at least thirty (30) days before the
meeting date determined under subsection (a) of this section.

17‑17‑124.  Execution of documents in more than one capacity.

Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an individual who holds more
than one (1) office in a statutory close corporation may execute,
acknowledge or verify in more than one (1) capacity any document
required to be executed, acknowledged or verified by the holders of two
(2) or more offices.

17‑17‑125.  Limited liability.

The failure of a statutory close corporation to observe the usual
corporate formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its
corporate powers or management of its business and affairs is not a
ground for imposing personal liability on the shareholders for
liabilities of the corporation.

17‑17‑130.  Merger, consolidation, share exchange and sale of assets.

(a)  A plan of merger, consolidation or share exchange that:

(i)  If effected would terminate statutory close corporation status must
be approved by the holders of at least two‑thirds (2/3) of the votes of
each class or series of shares of the statutory close corporation,
voting as separate voting groups, whether or not the holders are
otherwise entitled to vote on the plan;

(ii)  If effected would create the surviving or new corporation as a
statutory close corporation must be approved by the holders of at least
two‑thirds (2/3) of the votes of each class or series of shares of the
surviving corporation, voting as separate voting groups, whether or not
the holders are otherwise entitled to vote on the plan.

(b)  A sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, encumbrance or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the property, with or without the good
will, of a statutory close corporation, if not made in the usual and
regular course of business, must be approved by the holders of at least
two‑thirds (2/3) of the votes of each class or series of shares of the
corporation, voting as separate voting groups, whether or not the
holders are otherwise entitled to vote on the transaction.

17‑17‑131.  Termination of statutory close corporation status.

(a)  A statutory close corporation may terminate its statutory close
corporation status by amending its articles of incorporation to delete
the statement that it is a statutory close corporation. If the statutory
close corporation has elected to operate without a board of directors
under W.S. 17‑17‑121, the amendment must either comply with W.S.
17‑16‑801 or delete the statement dispensing with the board of directors
from its articles of incorporation.

(b)  An amendment terminating statutory close corporation status must be
approved by the holders of at least two‑thirds (2/3) of the votes of
each class or series of shares of the corporation, voting as separate
voting groups, whether or not the holders are otherwise entitled to vote
on amendments.

(c)  If an amendment to terminate statutory close corporation status is
adopted, each shareholder who voted against the amendment is entitled to
assert dissenters' rights under W.S. 17‑16‑1301 through 17‑16‑1331.

17‑17‑132.  Effect of termination of statutory close corporation status.

(a)  A corporation that terminates its status as a statutory close
corporation is thereafter subject to all provisions of the Wyoming
Business Corporation Act and, if incorporated under W.S. 17‑3‑101
through 17‑3‑104, to all provisions of those statutes.

(b)  Termination of statutory close corporation status does not affect
any right of a shareholder or of the corporation under an agreement or
the articles of incorporation unless this chapter, the Wyoming Business
Corporation Act, or another law of this state invalidates the right.

17‑17‑133.  Shareholder option to dissolve corporation.

(a)  The articles of incorporation of a statutory close corporation may
authorize one (1) or more shareholders, or the holders of a specified
number or percentage of shares of any class or series, to dissolve the
corporation at will or upon the occurrence of a specified event or
contingency. The shareholder or shareholders exercising this authority
must give written notice of the intent to dissolve to all the other
shareholders. Sixty (60) days after the effective date of the notice,
the corporation shall begin to wind up and liquidate its business and
affairs and file articles of dissolution under W.S. 17‑16‑1403 through
17‑16‑1407.

(b)  Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, an
amendment to the articles of incorporation to add, change or delete the
authority to dissolve described in subsection (a) of this section must
be approved by the holders of all the outstanding shares, whether or not

issued, by all the subscribers for shares, if any, or if none, by all
the incorporators.

17‑17‑140.  Court action to protect shareholders.

capacity as shareholder, director or officer of the corporation;

(ii)  The directors or those in control of the corporation are
deadlocked in the management of the corporation's affairs, the
shareholders are unable to break the deadlock, and the corporation is
suffering or will suffer irreparable injury or the business and affairs
of the corporation can no longer be conducted to the advantage of the
shareholders generally because of the deadlock; or

(iii)  There exists one (1) or more grounds for judicial dissolution of
the corporation under W.S. 17‑16‑1430.

(b)  A shareholder must commence a proceeding under subsection (a) of
this section in the district court of the county where the corporation's
principal office, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is
located. The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is
commenced is plenary and exclusive.

(c)  If a shareholder has agreed in writing to pursue a nonjudicial
remedy to resolve disputed matters, he may not commence a proceeding
under this section with respect to the matters until he has exhausted
the nonjudicial remedy.

(d)  If a shareholder has dissenters' rights under this chapter or W.S.
17‑16‑1301 through 17‑16‑1331 with respect to proposed corporate action,

addition to any other right or remedy he may have.

17‑17‑141.  Ordinary relief.

(a)  If the court finds that one (1) or more of the grounds for relief
described in W.S. 17‑17‑140(a) exist, it may order such relief as it
deems appropriate including one (1) or more of the following types of
relief:

(i)  The performance, prohibition, alteration or setting aside of any
action of the corporation or of its shareholders, directors, or officers
or of any other party to the proceeding;

17‑17‑142.  Extraordinary relief; share purchase.

(a)  If the court finds that the ordinary relief described in W.S.
17‑17‑141(a) is or would be inadequate or inappropriate, it may order
the corporation dissolved under W.S. 17‑17‑143 unless the corporation or
one (1) or more of its shareholders purchases all the shares of the
shareholder for their fair value and on terms determined under
subsection (b) of this section.

(b)  If the court orders a share purchase, it shall:

(i)  Determine the fair value of the shares, considering among other
relevant evidence the going concern value of the corporation, any
agreement among some or all of the shareholders fixing the price or
specifying a formula for determining share value for any purpose, the
recommendations of appraisers, if any, appointed by the court, and any
legal constraints on the corporation's ability to purchase the shares;

(ii)  Specify the terms of the purchase, including if appropriate terms
for installment payments, subordination of the purchase obligation to
the rights of the corporation's other creditors, security for a deferred
purchase price, and a covenant not to compete or other restriction on
the seller;

upon receipt of the purchase price or the first installment of the
purchase price;

price and a claim under any agreement with the corporation or the
remaining shareholders that is not terminated by the court; and

(v)  Provide that if the purchase is not completed in accordance with
the specified terms, the corporation is to be dissolved under W.S.
17‑17‑143.

(c)  After the purchase order is entered, any party may petition the
court to modify the terms of the purchase and the court may do so if it
finds that changes in the financial or legal ability of the corporation
or other purchaser to complete the purchase justify a modification.

(d)  If the corporation is dissolved because the share purchase was not
completed in accordance with the court's order, the selling shareholder
has the same rights and priorities in the corporation's assets as if the
sale had not been ordered.

17‑17‑143.  Extraordinary relief; dissolution.

(i)  There are one (1) or more grounds for judicial dissolution under
W.S. 17‑16‑1430; or

corporation has accumulated earnings or current operating profits.

17‑17‑150.  Application to existing corporations.

This chapter applies to all corporations electing statutory close
corporation status under W.S. 17‑17‑103 after its effective date.

qualified corporation. The election shall be made either:

(i)  Through a specific provision in the articles of incorporation;

(ii)  Through a statement in the bylaws that the corporation elects not

state. This election shall be authorized by the corporation's board of
directors and shall be effective from the date of filing with the

election becomes effective, all further acquisition of stock by the
offeror shall cease until the offer is in compliance with the
stockholder takeover protection provision of W.S. 17‑18‑105 through
17‑18‑111. The offeror may take any steps necessary to comply with these
provisions before the election becomes effective.

(c)  The election not to be subject to the shareholder takeover

No takeover offer shall be made which is not made to all offerees
holding the same class of equity securities of the target company on
substantially equivalent terms. A takeover offer to purchase less than

securities of the target company is not considered as having been made
to all offerees of that class on substantially equivalent terms if the
pro rata portion of equity securities of that class tendered by any
offeree which will be accepted by the offeror is not equal to the
highest pro rata portion of equity securities of that class tendered by
any other offeree which will be accepted by the offeror. A takeover
offer permitting offerees to elect to receive one (1) or more differing
kinds of consideration is not considered as having been made to all
offerees holding the same class of equity securities of the target
company on substantially equivalent terms if proration occurs and the

securities of target company.

a target company at any time within two (2) years following the
conclusion of a takeover offer with respect to that class, including but
not limited to acquisitions made by purchase, exchange, merger,
consolidation, partial or complete liquidation, redemption, reverse
stock split, and any other recapitalization or reorganization, unless
the holder of that equity security is also afforded, at the time of that
acquisition, a reasonable opportunity to dispose of that security to the
offeror upon substantially equivalent terms. If a takeover offer is made
or concluded while the election to be subject to the shareholder
takeover protection provisions is in effect, the requirement of this
section shall remain in effect for two (2) years following the
conclusion of the takeover offer even if the election is subsequently
terminated.

17‑18‑110.  Takeover offer; untrue statements or omission of material
facts unlawful.

in opposition to or in favor of any takeover offer, it is unlawful for
any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,
in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, or to engage in any fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative
acts or practices.

17‑18‑111.  Exemptions to takeover requirements; burden of establishing

acquisitions of equity securities of the same class during the preceding
twelve (12) months by the offeror or any of its affiliates do not exceed
two percent (2%) of that class; or

a takeover offer that is not made for the purpose of, and not having the
effect of, changing or influencing the control of a target company.

(b)  An order may only be adopted under paragraph (a)(ii) of this
section after a hearing pursuant to W.S. 17‑18‑113.

(c)  The burden of establishing entitlement to any exemption is on the
offeror.

17‑18‑112.  Administration; regulations; rulemaking authority;
individual liability of state officers or employees prohibited.

(a)  This act shall be administered by the secretary of state of
Wyoming.

(b)  The secretary of state may promulgate reasonable rules and
regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of this act.

liable in their individual capacity, except to the state of Wyoming, for

matter. Any interested person may petition the secretary of state for a
hearing if that person reasonably believes a violation of W.S. 17‑18‑105

deposit in an amount to be determined by the secretary of state.

(d)  The target company, the offeror, any offeree, and any other person
whose interests may be affected have the right to appear at any hearing
held pursuant to this section, and to become a party to the proceeding.
Any person appearing at or party to the hearing has the rights granted
in the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.

(e)  If the secretary of state finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the takeover statement fails to provide full and fair disclosure to
the offerees of all material information concerning the takeover offer
or that the takeover offer is not made to all offerees of the same class
of equity securities of the target company on substantially equivalent
terms, he shall by order prohibit the purchase of shares tendered in
response to the takeover offer or condition purchase upon changes or
modifications.

(f)  In the case of a takeover offer subject to the approval of the
insurance commissioner, the offeror within five (5) days after the
statement is filed shall mail a notice to all offerees of the target
company advising them of the general terms and conditions of the
takeover offer and the date of the hearing at which they may appear. No
shares shall be contracted for, purchased or paid for until after

orders without notice. In addition to all other remedies, he may bring

this act or any regulation or order adopted under this act, the offeror,
target company or any record or beneficial owner of an equity security
of the target company may bring an action in the district court of the
county where the target company has its principal office or Natrona
county to enjoin that person from continuing or doing any act in
violation of this act or to enforce compliance with this act.

(c)  Upon a proper showing, the court may grant a permanent or
preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order or may order
rescission of any sales, tenders for sale, purchases or tenders for
purchase of equity securities determined to be unlawful under this act
or any rule or regulation or order of the secretary of state. The court
shall not require the secretary of state to post a bond.

17‑18‑115.  Judicial review.

An appeal may be taken by any offeror, target company, or other party to
any proceeding before the secretary of state from any final order of the
secretary of state by filing a petition for review within thirty (30)

Wyoming Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or a similar act. If the
beneficial owner of the shares is an entity other than a natural person,
the shares may be voted by any duly authorized officer of that entity.

individuals designated by the corporation provided:

intention to vote against the recommendation of the board or management
of the corporation on that issue.

(f)  If the articles of incorporation permit the board to impose
restrictions on the use of proxies and a court orders a shareholder's
meeting, the board may still impose the restrictions provided if it does
so within ten (10) days of the meeting or within half the total number
of days between the date of the court order and the date of the meeting,
whichever is less. The time periods for notice of issues and mailing
deadlines set forth in subsection (e) of this section shall not apply to

shareholder at or after the meeting who is bringing a legal challenge to
the right of any other shareholder to vote at the meeting; and

(iii)  The list is available for inspection but not copying as provided
by subsection (a) of this section and at the meeting. The making of
handwritten copies by the shareholder or his attorney of the names and
addresses of individual shareholders shall not be construed as copying
within the meaning of this subsection.

(c)  A qualified corporation may take any other steps it deems
reasonable or necessary to prevent the use of its shareholder lists for
purposes not related to issues under consideration at a shareholder
meeting.

17‑18‑119.  Special meeting request exceptions.

In addition to the limitations on the matters that may be considered at
annual meetings otherwise allowed by statute a qualified corporation may
in its bylaws authorize the board to further limit the matters which an
annual meeting may consider. The limitations shall not include
elimination of the election of directors whose terms expire at the
annual meeting. The limitations may take the form of excluding specified
matters from consideration, allowing consideration of only certain
specified matters, or requiring advance notice of the consideration of
certain matters.

17‑18‑121.  Action by less than a quorum.

(a)  Stockholders present or represented by proxy at an annual or
special meeting of a qualified corporation at which a quorum is not
present may take only the following actions:

(i)  Ratify or reject the independent auditors selected by the board if
the corporation's bylaws or articles of incorporation require approval
of the auditors by a stockholder's meeting;

(ii)  With the consent of the officer presiding at the meeting, receive
or hear any reports on the affairs of the corporation that may be
presented;

(iii)  Within the constraints of the time allowed on the agenda, ask
questions concerning the affairs of the corporation of any officer or
board member present;

(iv)  Adjourn or recess the meeting to allow time to assemble a quorum,
but they may not adjourn or recess to a different city and the total of
all the adjournments and recesses may not exceed two (2) business days
without the consent of the board of directors;

(v)  If a quorum is not present, may adjourn the meeting sine die,
provided the motion to adjourn sine die shall not be in order until at
least two (2) hours have passed since the time specified for the start
of the meeting and the time at which the meeting was called to order.

(b)  If an annual meeting of a qualified corporation is adjourned sine
die without achieving a quorum, the requirement of W.S. 17‑16‑701 to

board to call another special meeting shall be to follow the procedures
necessary for calling a new special meeting.

ARTICLE 2

BONDHOLDER PROTECTION PROVISIONS

17‑18‑201.  Protection provisions; applicability; defined.

(a)  A qualified corporation may, if its articles of incorporation
authorize it to utilize the bondholder protection provisions of this
act, utilize any of the provisions set forth in subsection (b) of this
section. These protections shall apply only to bonds, debentures or
other debt instruments whose original aggregate value at maturity is
equal to or greater than five million dollars (\$5,000,000.00) and whose
original term is two (2) years or greater. Any number of bondholder
protection provisions may be in effect at any time.

(b)  A qualified corporation may provide bondholder protection by
requiring any or all of the following:

(i)  Bondholder approval of the replacement of more than twenty‑four
percent (24%) of the directors in any twelve (12) month period. The
filling of vacancies created by the death or resignation of directors
shall not be counted against the twenty‑four percent (24%) limit
provided that those vacancies are filled by nominees of the board of
directors. If more than twenty‑four percent (24%) of the directors are
to be replaced, the approval of holders of a majority of the bonds shall
be obtained in writing at the meeting where the directors are to be
replaced or no more than thirty (30) days prior to the meeting. The
consent of the bondholders shall be obtained to exceeding the
twenty‑four percent (24%) limit rather than to the individual directors
to be replaced. If consent is denied, which directors are to be replaced
shall be determined by the relative number of votes for each director by
shares entitled to vote;

(ii)  Bondholder consent to any merger or acquisition which the
corporation may be subject to or which the corporation may make, subject
to the following:

(A)  The notice of bondholder protection shall specify the size of
merger or acquisition at or above which the bondholder consent is
required. The size may vary depending on whether the company is the
acquiring party or is being acquired. In a merger the relative
memberships on the board of directors of the surviving corporation may
be used to determine whether or not bondholder consent is required;

(B)  The term acquisition shall be deemed to include the purchase of
more than a specified percentage of the shares entitled to vote for
directors by a person or combination of persons under common ownership
or control or acting in concert. If a person or combination of persons
acquires more than the specified percentage of shares, they shall be
entitled to vote only the specified percentage until bondholder consent
is acquired. The specified percentage shall be set in the notice of
bondholder protection and shall not be less than ten percent (10%);

(C)  The bondholder consent shall be to a specific merger or acquisition
rather than the general concept of mergers and acquisitions.

(iii)  Bondholder consent to the sale or disposal of certain assets, or
assets exceeding a certain percentage of the corporation's total assets,
or assets exceeding a set total value or any combination of these
factors. The specifics of what requires bondholder consent shall be set
forth in the notice of bondholder protection. Disposal of assets shall
be construed to include the disposition of the assets to the
shareholders either directly or through distribution of shares in a new
or subsidiary corporation;

(iv)  Bondholder consent to the acquisition of debt above a specified
percentage of total assets, a specified percentage of the net worth of
the corporation, a specific amount, or any combination of these factors.
The consent may be required generally or may be required only if the
debt is to be used to pay for a merger or acquisition or a distribution
to shareholders. The notice of bondholder protection shall specify the
conditions under which bondholder consent is required.

17‑18‑202.  Bondholder protection provision; adoption requirements;
revocation.

(a)  The corporation utilizes a bondholder protection provision by
adopting and filing with the secretary of state a notice of bondholder
protection as provided in this section.

(b)  The notice of bondholder protection shall specify the percentage of
bondholders whose consent is required for any action on that protection.
The percentage may be different for different purposes. The percentage
shall be not less than fifty percent (50%) nor greater than ninety
percent (90%). The percentage shall be a percentage of the value at
maturity of the bonds or other debt instruments issued and outstanding.

(c)  Notices of bondholder protection shall be approved by the
corporation in the same manner as changes in corporate bylaws except
that the articles of incorporation may specify a different manner of
approval. The notices shall be filed with the trustee or transfer agent,
if any, for the bonds and with the secretary of state. The notice filed
with the secretary of state shall be accompanied by the administrative
fee specified by regulation to recover the administrative costs of the
state of Wyoming. The notice shall be effective as of the date of filing
with the secretary of state. The corporation shall send to each known
bondholder by first class mail either the full notice of bondholder
protection or a summary of the notice and information as to how the full
notice may be obtained from the company. This notice to the bondholders
shall be given no later than the due date of the first interest payment
due more than thirty (30) days after the bondholder protection notice is
filed with the secretary of state and may be included with the mailing
of the interest payment.

(d)  Bondholder protections may be revoked by the corporation in the
same manner that notices of bondholder protection are issued and filed
except that the revocation is effective as of a date specified in the
notice filed with the secretary of state. The effective date shall be at
least two (2) years and not more than six (6) years after filing the
notice of revocation with the secretary of state.

17‑18‑203.  Bondholder protection provision; amendments.

(a)  At any time any amendment may be made to the bondholder protection
provisions with the consent of the percentage of bondholders required
for action as stated in the notice of bondholder protection. Such an
amendment shall be effective upon filing the bondholder's consent and
notice of amendment with the secretary of state. However, the effective
date shall be specified in the notice and shall be at least two (2)
years and not more than six (6) years after filing the bondholder's
consent and notice of the amendment with the secretary of state for
amendments which:

(i)  Change the time period for revocations to be effective;

(ii)  Decrease the percentage of bondholders required for approval of an
action;

(iii)  Eliminate the requirement of bondholder approval for a specific
action; or

(iv)  Otherwise decrease the protection available to bondholders.

(b)  The bondholder's consent shall be in writing signed by the
bondholder or his lawful agent or trustee. Unless otherwise specified in
W.S. 17‑18‑201 through 17‑18‑206 the consent is valid until revoked by
the bondholder. The sale of the bond or debt instrument by the
bondholder revokes the consent effective upon notification of the
corporation or transfer agent of the sale.

17‑18‑204.  Limitations of the bondholder protection provisions.

(a)  Nothing in the bondholder protection provisions shall be construed
or applied to abridge or prohibit any contract, covenant or restriction
made between any corporation and its bondholders, or any holder of any
other debt instrument provided the contract, covenant or restriction
would be lawful in the absence of W.S. 17‑18‑201 through 17‑18‑206.
Unless specifically prohibited by prior contract any eligible
corporation may extend to the holders of any bond or debt instrument
described in W.S. 17‑18‑201(a) the opportunity to receive any bondholder
protection provisions. If a corporation represents to potential
purchasers of bonds in any prospectus or other written advice to
potential purchasers that it has extended or intends to extend any
bondholder protection provisions, it shall also state in the same
document that the protections may be revoked as provided by W.S.
17‑18‑201 through 17‑18‑206.

(b)  Protections under W.S. 17‑18‑201 through 17‑18‑206 shall be
extended uniformly to all holders of the same class of bond or debt
instrument but need not be extended uniformly to all classes of bonds or
debt instruments.

17‑18‑205.  Bondholder definition.

The term bondholder shall include the owners of any debt instrument to
which bondholder protections are extended.

17‑18‑206.  Additional bondholder protection provisions allowed.

Any other bondholder protection provisions may be provided in the notice
of bondholder protection, and shall be valid unless inconsistent with
the provisions of W.S. 17‑18‑201 through 17‑18‑206 or other law.

provide in its articles of incorporation or bylaws that this article
does not apply to control share acquisitions of shares of the

principal office in the state, the district court of the county where
its registered office is or will be located, or the district court of

document or take other action the court considers appropriate.

proceedings.

17‑19‑127.  Evidentiary effect of copy of filed document.

member or director at the time of bringing the proceeding.

(c)  A complaint in a proceeding brought in the right of a corporation
shall be verified and allege with particularity the demand made, if any,
to obtain action by the directors and either why the complainants could
not obtain the action or why they did not make the demand. If a demand
for action was made and the corporation's investigation of the demand is
in progress when the proceeding is filed, the court may stay the suit
until the investigation is completed.

complainants to pay any defendant's reasonable expenses, including

received by the complainants as the result of a judgment, compromise or
settlement of an action or claim, the court may award the complainants
reasonable expenses, including counsel fees.

membership meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting
unless the board fixes a new date for determining the right to notice or
the right to vote, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a
date more than seventy (70) days after the record date for determining
members entitled to notice of the original meeting.

(f)  If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than one

shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its members who
are entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall show the address
and number of votes each member is entitled to vote at the meeting. The
corporation shall prepare on a current basis through the time of the
membership meeting a list of members, if any, who are entitled to vote
at the meeting, but not entitled to notice of the meeting. This list
shall be prepared on the same basis and be part of the list of members.

(b)  The list of members shall be available for inspection by any member
for the purpose of communication with other members concerning the
meeting, beginning two (2) business days after notice is given of the
meeting for which the list was prepared and continuing through the
meeting, at the corporation's principal office or at a reasonable place
identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be
held. A member, a member's agent or attorney is entitled on written
demand to inspect and, subject to the limitations of W.S. 17‑19‑1602(c)
and 17‑19‑1605, to copy the list, at a reasonable time and at the
member's expense, during the period it is available for inspection.

meeting, and any member, a member's agent or attorney is entitled to
inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.

attorney to inspect the list of members before or at the meeting, or
copy the list as permitted by subsection (b) of this section, the
district court of the county where a corporation's principal office, or
if none in this state, its registered office is located, on application
of the member, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the
corporation's expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list
was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete and may order
the corporation to pay the member's costs, including reasonable counsel
fees, incurred to obtain the order.

(e)  Unless a written demand to inspect and copy a membership list has
been made under subsection (b) of this section prior to the membership
meeting and a corporation improperly refuses to comply with the demand,
refusal or failure to comply with this section does not affect the
validity of action taken at the meeting.

abolish the rights of a member under this section to inspect and copy
any corporate record.

rata basis.

action shall be approved by the members.

person or by proxy, the only matters that can be voted upon at an annual
or regular meeting of members are those matters that are described in
the meeting notice.

17‑19‑723.  Voting requirements.

(a)  Unless this act, the articles or the bylaws require a greater vote
or voting by class, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the

(b)  A bylaw amendment to increase or decrease the vote required for any
member action shall be approved by the members.

signing an appointment form either personally or by an attorney‑in‑fact.

(c)  An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the
secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. An

expressly provided in the appointment form; provided however that no
proxy shall be valid for more than three (3) years from its date of
execution.

(d)  An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the member.

(e)  The death or incapacity of the member appointing a proxy does not
affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy's authority
unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or
other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy
exercises authority under the appointment.

(f)  Appointment of a proxy is revoked by the person appointing the
proxy:

(i)  Attending any meeting and voting in person; or

appointment of the proxy is revoked or a subsequent appointment form.

(g)  Subject to W.S. 17‑19‑727 and any express limitation on the proxy's
authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, a corporation
is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the
member making the appointment.

(i)  The meeting notice or statement accompanying the notice states that
cumulative voting will take place; or

entitled to cumulate their votes without giving further notice.

(c)  A director elected by cumulative voting may be removed by the
members without cause if the requirements of W.S. 17‑19‑808 are met
unless the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to
removal, would be sufficient to elect the director if voted cumulatively
at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if
such action is taken by written ballot, all memberships entitled to vote
were voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of
the director's most recent election were then being elected.

(d)  Members shall not cumulatively vote if the directors and members
are identical.

describing the action taken, signed by each director, and included in
the minutes filed with the corporate records reflecting the action
taken.

one‑third (1/3) of the number of directors in office or two (2)

(a)  Unless prohibited or limited by the articles or bylaws, a board of

restrictions imposed by the donor or transferor of such property.

(b)  Members of a board of any nonprofit corporation organized under
this act are not individually liable for any actions, inactions or
omissions by the nonprofit corporation. This subsection does not affect
individual liability for intentional torts or illegal acts. This
subsection also does not prevent removal of a board member by court
order pursuant to W.S. 17‑19‑810.

17‑19‑831.  Director conflict of interest.

(a)  A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the
corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or
indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable if
the transaction was fair at the time it was entered into or is approved
as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section.

(b)  A transaction in which a director of a public benefit or religious
corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved:

(i)  In advance by the vote of the board of directors or a committee of
the board if:

(A)  The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest
are disclosed or known to the board or committee of the board; and

(B)  The directors approving the transaction in good faith reasonably
believe that the transaction is fair to the corporation; or

(A)  Attorney general; or

(B)  District court in an action in which the attorney general is joined
as a party.

(c)  A transaction in which a director of a mutual benefit corporation
has a conflict of interest may be approved if:

(i)  The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest
were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the
board and the board or committee of the board authorized, approved or
ratified the transaction; or

(ii)  The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest
were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved or
ratified the transaction.

(d)  For purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an
indirect interest in a transaction if:

(i)  Another entity in which the director has a material interest or in
which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction;
or

(ii)  Another entity of which the director is a director, officer or
trustee is a party to the transaction.

(e)  For purposes of subsections (b) and (c) of this section a conflict
of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified, if it
receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the
board or on the committee, who have no direct or indirect interest in
the transaction, but a transaction shall not be authorized, approved or
ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the
directors on the board who have no direct or indirect interest in the
transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a
quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section.
The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect
interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action
taken under paragraph (b)(i) or (c)(i) of this section if the
transaction is otherwise approved as provided in subsection (b) or (c)
of this section.

(f)  For purposes of paragraph (c)(ii) of this section, a conflict of
interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified by the members
if it receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted under this
subsection. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who
has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and votes cast by
or voted under the control of an entity described in paragraph (d)(i) of
this section, shall not be counted in a vote of members to determine
whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest
transaction under paragraph (c)(ii) of this section. The vote of these
members, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is
approved under other sections of this act. A majority of the voting
power, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote
on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the
purpose of taking action under this section.

(g)  The articles, bylaws or a resolution of the board may impose
additional requirements on conflict of interest transactions.

17‑19‑832.  Loans to or guaranties for directors and officers.

(a)  A corporation shall not lend money to nor guarantee the obligation
of a director or officer of the corporation except as provided in W.S.

section does not affect the borrower's liability on the loan.

shall have a president, a secretary, a treasurer and any other officers
as are appointed by the board.

(b)  The bylaws or the board shall delegate to one (1) of the officers
responsibility for preparing minutes of the directors' and members'
meetings and for authenticating records of the corporation.

(c)  The same individual may simultaneously hold more than one (1)
office in a corporation.

17‑19‑841.  Duties and authority of officers.

Each officer has the authority and shall perform the duties set forth in
the bylaws or, to the extent consistent with the bylaws, the duties and
authority prescribed in a resolution of the board or by direction of an
officer authorized by the board to prescribe the duties and authority of
other officers.

interests of the corporation and its members, if any.

(b)  In discharging his duties an officer who is an employee of the
corporation is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or
statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if
prepared or presented by:

(i)  One (1) or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the
officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters
presented;

(ii)  Legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters
the officer reasonably believes are within the person's professional or
expert competence; or

(iii)  In the case of religious corporations, religious authorities and
ministers, priests, rabbis or other persons whose position or duties in
the religious organization the officer believes justify reliance and
confidence and whom the officer believes to be reliable and competent in
the matters presented.

(c)  An officer who is an employee of the corporation is not acting in
good faith if the officer has knowledge concerning the matter in
question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection (b) of
this section unwarranted.

(d)  An officer who is an employee of the corporation is not liable to
the corporation, any member or other person for any action taken or not
taken as an officer, if the officer acted in compliance with this
section.

(e)  An officer of a corporation organized under this act, who is not an
employee of the corporation is not individually liable for any actions,
inactions or omissions by the corporation. This subsection does not
affect individual liability for intentional torts or illegal acts.

(f)  Whether or not he is an employee of the corporation, an officer
shall not be deemed to be a trustee with respect to the corporation or
with respect to any property held or administered by the corporation,
including without limit, property that may be subject to restrictions

(a)  An officer may resign at any time by delivering notice to the
corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is effective
unless the notice specifies a future effective date. If a resignation is

effective date, its board of directors may fill the pending vacancy
before the effective date if the board provides that the successor
cannot take office until the effective date.

(b)  A board may remove any officer at any time with or without cause.

17‑19‑844.  Contract rights of officers.

(a)  The appointment of an officer does not itself create contract
rights.

(b)  An officer's removal does not affect the officer's contract rights,
if any, with the corporation. An officer's resignation does not affect
the corporation's contract rights, if any, with the officer.

17‑19‑845.  Officers' authority to execute documents.

(a)  Any contract or other instrument in writing executed or entered
into between a corporation and any other person is not invalidated as to
the corporation by any lack of authority of the signing officers in the
absence of actual knowledge on the part of the other person that the
signing officers had no authority to execute the contract or other
instrument if it is signed by any two (2) officers in Category 1 below
or by one (1) officer in Category 1 below and one (1) individual in
Category 2 below:

(i)  Category 1‑The presiding officer of the board and the president;

Unless limited by its articles of incorporation, a corporation shall

the director is not wholly successful; and

(ii)  A determination is made that the facts then known to those making

foreign or domestic business or nonprofit corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against
liability asserted against or incurred by him in that capacity or

(c)  If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded,

ARTICLE 17

DOMESTICATION AND CONTINUANCE OF

FOREIGN CORPORATION

17‑19‑1701.  Domestication of foreign corporations.

Any nonprofit corporation incorporated under the laws of any of the
several states of the United States for any purpose, and so long as the
corporation complies with W.S. 17‑19‑301(b), may become a domestic
corporation of this state by delivering or causing to be delivered to
the secretary of state articles of domestication. Upon filing the
articles of domestication, the secretary of state shall issue to the
foreign corporation a certificate of domestication which shall continue
the corporation as if it had been incorporated under this act. The
articles of domestication, upon being filed by the secretary of state,
constitute the articles of the domesticated foreign corporation and it
shall thereafter have all the powers and privileges and be subjected to
all the duties and limitations granted and imposed upon domestic
nonprofit corporations under the provisions of this act. A corporation
does not become a resident for the purpose of W.S. 16‑6‑101 through
16‑6‑118 solely because it becomes a domestic nonprofit corporation
under this section.

17‑19‑1702.  Application for certificate of domestication; articles of
domestication.

(a)  A foreign corporation, in order to procure a certificate of
domestication shall file articles of domestication with the secretary of
state, which articles shall include and set forth:

authorization, and a certificate of good standing not more than thirty
(30) days old;

(ii)  The name of the corporation and the jurisdiction under the laws of
which it is incorporated;

(iii)  The date of incorporation and the period of duration of the
corporation;

(iv)  The address of the principal office of the corporation and the
jurisdiction under the laws of which it is incorporated;

(v)  The address of the proposed registered office of the corporation in
this state, and the name of its proposed registered agent in this state
at that address;

(vi)  The purpose or purposes of the corporation which it proposes to
pursue in the transaction of affairs in this state;

(vii)  The names and addresses of the directors and officers of the
corporation;

(viii)  A statement of whether it is a public benefit corporation, a
mutual benefit corporation or a religious corporation;

(ix)  A statement whether the corporation has members;

(x)  A statement that the corporation accepts the constitution of this
state in compliance with the requirement of article 10, section 5 of the
Wyoming constitution; and

(xi)  Any additional information as may be necessary or appropriate to
enable the secretary of state to determine whether the corporation is
entitled to a certificate of domestication evidencing its authority to
transact its affairs and business in this state.

17‑19‑1710.  Continuance of foreign corporations.

(a)  Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any nonprofit
corporation incorporated for any purpose under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than this state, and so long as the corporation
complies with W.S. 17‑19‑301(b), may, if the jurisdiction will
acknowledge the corporation's termination of domicile in the foreign
jurisdiction, apply to the secretary of state for registration under
this act, thus continuing the foreign corporation in Wyoming as if it
had been incorporated in this state. The secretary of state may issue a
certificate of registration upon receipt of an application supported by
articles of continuance as provided by this act together with the
statements, information and documents set out in subsection (c) of this
section. The certificate of registration may then be issued subject to
any limitations and conditions and may contain any provisions as may
appear proper to the secretary of state.

(b)  The secretary of state shall cause notice of issuance of a
certificate of registration to be given forthwith to the proper officer
of the jurisdiction in which the corporation was previously
incorporated.

(c)  The articles of continuance filed by a foreign corporation with the
secretary of state shall contain:

(i)  A certified copy of its original articles of incorporation and all
amendments thereto or its equivalent basic corporate charter or other
authorization;

(ii)  The name of the corporation and the jurisdiction under the laws of
which it is incorporated;

(iii)  The date of incorporation and the period of duration of the
corporation;

(iv)  The address of the principal office of the corporation;

(v)  The address of the proposed registered office of the corporation in
this state and the name of its proposed registered agent in this state
at the address;

(vi)  The purpose or purposes of the corporation which it proposes to
pursue in the transaction of business in this state;

(vii)  The names and respective addresses of the directors and officers
of the corporation;

(viii)  A statement of whether it is a public benefit corporation, a
mutual benefit corporation or a religious corporation;

(ix)  A statement whether the corporation has members;

(x)  A statement that the corporation accepts the constitution of this
state in compliance with the requirements of article 10, section 5 of
the Wyoming constitution;

(xi)  Any additional information necessary or appropriate to enable the
secretary of state to determine whether the corporation is entitled to a
certificate of registration evidencing its authority to transact its
affairs and business in the state; and

(xii)  Any additional information permitted in articles of incorporation
under W.S. 17‑19‑202.

(d)  The application shall be executed by the corporation by its
president or other officer, director, trustee, manager or person
performing functions equivalent to those of a president and who is
authorized to execute the application on behalf of the corporation and
shall be verified by the officer signing the application.

(e)  The provisions of the articles of continuance may, without
expressly so stating, vary from the provisions of the corporation's
articles of incorporation or equivalent basic corporate charter or other
authorization, if the variation is one which a corporation incorporated
under this act could effect by way of amendment to its articles of
incorporation. Upon issuance of a certificate of continuance by the
secretary of state, the articles of continuance shall be deemed to be
the articles of incorporation of the continued corporation. The
corporation may elect to incorporate by reference in the articles of
continuance its basic corporate charter or other authorization which had
been adopted by the corporation in the foreign jurisdiction, in order to
permit the same to continue to act as the articles of incorporation of
the corporation, provided, however, that such basic corporate charter or
other authorization shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to
make the same conform to the laws of Wyoming and to the provisions of
the articles of continuance.

(f)  Except for the purpose of W.S. 16‑6‑101 through 16‑6‑118, the
existence of any corporation heretofore or hereafter issued a
certificate of continuance under this act shall be deemed to have
commenced on the date the corporation commenced its existence in the
jurisdiction in which the corporation was first formed, incorporated or
otherwise came into being. The laws of Wyoming shall apply to a
corporation continuing under this act to the same extent as if the
corporation had been incorporated under the laws of Wyoming from and
after the issuance of a certificate of continuance under this act by the
secretary of state to the corporation. When a foreign corporation is
continued as a corporation under this act, such continuance shall not
affect the corporation's ownership of its property or liability for any
existing obligations, causes of action, claims, pending or threatened
prosecutions or civil or administrative actions, convictions, rulings,
orders, judgments or any other characteristics or aspects of the
corporation and its existence.

(g)  A membership issued before the corporation's continuance in Wyoming
is deemed to have been issued in compliance with this act and the
provisions of the articles of continuance. Continuance under this act
does not deprive a member of any right or privilege that he claims
under, or relieve the member of any liability in respect of, an issued
membership.

(h)  As used in this section, the term "corporation" shall include any
incorporated organization, foundation, trust, association or similar
entity which appears to the secretary of state to possess
characteristics sufficiently similar to those of a corporation organized
under this act.

(b)  A certified copy of a statement that has been filed in the office
of the secretary of state that is recorded in the office for recording
transfers of real property shall have the effect provided for recorded
statements in this chapter. A recorded statement that is not a certified
copy of a statement filed in the office of the secretary of state shall
not have the effect provided for recorded statements in this chapter.

(c)  A statement filed by a partnership must be executed by at least two
(2) partners. Other statements must be executed by a partner or other

ARTICLE 2

NATURE OF PARTNERSHIP

17‑21‑201.  Partnership as entity.

A partnership is an entity.

17‑21‑202.  Creation of partnership.

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the
association of two (2) or more persons to carry on as co‑owners of a
business for profit creates a partnership, whether or not the persons
intend to create a partnership.

(b)  An association created under a statute other than this chapter, any
predecessor law or comparable law of another jurisdiction is not a
partnership.

(c)  In determining whether a partnership is created, the following
rules apply:

(i)  Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint
property, common property or part ownership does not by itself establish
a partnership, even if the co‑owners share profits made by the use of
the property;

(ii)  The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a
partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common
right or interest in property from which the returns are derived;

(iii)  The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business
is prima facie evidence that the person is a partner in the business,
but that inference may not be drawn if the profits were received in
payment:

(A)  Of a debt by installments or otherwise;

(B)  For services as an independent contractor or of wages or other
compensation to an employee;

(C)  Of rent;

(D)  Of an annuity or other retirement or health benefit to a
beneficiary, representative or designee of a deceased or retired
partner;

(E)  Of interest or other charge on a loan, even if the amount of
payment varies with the profits of the business, including a direct or
indirect present or future ownership of the collateral or rights to
income, proceeds or increase in value derived from the collateral; or

(F)  Of consideration for the sale of the goodwill of a business or
other property by installments or otherwise.

(d)  Except as provided by W.S. 17‑21‑308, persons who are not partners
as to each other are not partners as to other persons.

(e)  A partnership created under this chapter is a general partnership
and the partners are general partners of the partnership.

17‑21‑203.  Partnership property.

Property transferred to or otherwise acquired by a partnership is
property of the partnership and not of the partners individually.

17‑21‑204.  When property is partnership property.

(a)  Property is partnership property if acquired:

(i)  In the name of the partnership; or

(ii)  In the name of one (1) or more partners with an indication in the
instrument transferring title to the property of the person's capacity
as a partner or of the existence of a partnership, but without an
indication of the name of the partnership.

(b)  Property is acquired in the name of the partnership by a transfer
to:

(i)  The partnership in its name; or

(ii)  One (1) or more partners in their capacity as partners in the
partnership, if the name of the partnership is indicated in the
instrument transferring title to the property.

(c)  Property is presumed to be partnership property if purchased with
partnership assets, even if not acquired in the name of the partnership
or of one (1) or more partners with an indication in the instrument
transferring title to the property of the person's capacity as a partner
or of the existence of a partnership.

(d)  Property acquired in the name of one (1) or more of the partners,
without an indication in the instrument transferring title to the
property of the person's capacity as a partner or of the existence of a
partnership and without use of partnership assets, is presumed to be
separate property even if used for partnership purposes.

ARTICLE 3

RELATIONS OF PARTNERS TO PERSONS

DEALING WITH PARTNERSHIP

17‑21‑301.  Partner agent of partnership.

(a)  Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority
pursuant to W.S. 17‑21‑303:

(i)  Each partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its
business. Any act of a partner, including the execution of an instrument
in the partnership name, for apparently carrying on in the usual way the
partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the
partnership binds the partnership, unless the partner has no authority
to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with
whom the partner is dealing knows or has received a notice that the
partner lacks authority;

(ii)  An act of a partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the
usual way the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by
the partnership does not bind the partnership unless authorized by the
other partners.

17‑21‑302.  Transfer of partnership property.

(a)  Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority
pursuant to W.S. 17‑21‑303:

(i)  Partnership property held in the name of the partnership may be
transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by any partner in the
partnership name;

(ii)  Partnership property held in the name of one (1) or more partners
with an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them
of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, but
without an indication of the name of the partnership, may be transferred
by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the
property is held;

(iii)  A partnership may recover property transferred under this
subsection if it proves that execution of the instrument of transfer did
not bind the partnership under W.S. 17‑21‑301, unless the property was
transferred by the initial transferee or a person claiming through the
initial transferee to a subsequent transferee who gave value without
having notice that the person who executed the instrument of initial
transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.

(b)  Partnership property held in the name of one (1) or more persons
other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument
transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of
the existence of a partnership, may be transferred free of any claims of
the partnership or the partners by the persons in whose name the
property is held to a transferee who gives value without having notice
that it is partnership property.

(c)  If a person holds all of the partners' interests in the
partnership, all of the partnership property vests in that person. That
person may execute documents in the name of the partnership to evidence
vesting of the property in that person and may file or record those
documents.

17‑21‑303.  Statement of partnership authority.

(a)  A partnership may file a statement of partnership authority, which:

(i)  Shall include:

(A)  The name of the partnership;

(B)  The street address of its chief executive office and of an office
in this state, if any;

(C)  The names and mailing addresses of all the partners or of an agent
appointed and maintained by the partnership for the purpose of
subsection (b) of this section; and

(D)  A statement specifying the names of the partners authorized to
execute an instrument transferring real property held in the name of the
partnership.

(ii)  May include a statement of the authority, or of limitations on the
authority, of some or all of the partners to enter into other
transactions on behalf of the partnership and any other matter.

(b)  If a statement of partnership authority names an agent, the agent
shall maintain a list of the names and mailing addresses of all of the
partners and make it available to any person on request for good cause
shown.

(c)  If a filed statement of partnership authority is executed pursuant
to W.S. 17‑21‑105(c) and states the name of the partnership but does not
contain all of the other information required by subsection (a) of this
section, the statement nevertheless operates with respect to a person
not a partner as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section.

(d)  Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, a filed
statement of partnership authority supplements the authority of a
partner to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership as
follows:

(i)  Except for transfers of real property, a grant of authority
contained in a filed statement of partnership authority is conclusive,
in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary,
so long as and to the extent that a limitation on that authority is not
then contained in another filed statement. A filed cancellation of a
limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority;

(ii)  A grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of
the partnership contained in a certified copy of a filed statement of
partnership authority recorded in the office for recording transfers of
that real property is conclusive, in favor of a person who gives value
without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a
certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on that
authority is not then recorded in the office for recording transfers of
that real property. The recording in the office for recording transfers
of that real property of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a
limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.

(e)  A person not a partner is deemed to know of a limitation on the
authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the
partnership if a certified copy of the filed statement containing the
limitation on authority is recorded in the office for recording
transfers of that real property.

(f)  Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section and
W.S. 17‑21‑704 and 17‑21‑806, a person not a partner is not deemed to
know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the
limitation is contained in a filed statement.

(g)  Unless earlier canceled, a filed statement of partnership authority
is canceled by operation of law five (5) years after the date on which
the statement or the most recent amendment was filed with the secretary
of state.

17‑21‑304.  Statement of denial.

A partner or other person named as a partner in a filed statement of
partnership authority or in a list maintained by an agent pursuant to
W.S. 17‑21‑303(b) may file a statement of denial stating the name of the
partnership and the fact that is being denied, which may include denial
of a person's authority or status as a partner. A statement of denial is
a limitation on authority to the extent provided in W.S. 17‑21‑303(d)
and (e).

17‑21‑305.  Partnership liable for partner's actionable conduct.

(a)  A partnership is liable for loss or injury caused to a person or
for a penalty incurred as a result of a wrongful act or omission or
other actionable conduct of a partner acting in the ordinary course of
business of the partnership or with the authority of the partnership.

(b)  If in the course of its business, a partnership receives money or
property of a person not a partner which is misapplied by a partner
while it is in the custody of the partnership, the partnership is liable
for the loss.

17‑21‑306.  Partner's liability.

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, all partners
are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership
unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.

(b)  Except as provided by subsections (c) and (d) of this section, a
partner of a registered limited liability partnership is not liable,
directly or indirectly (including by way of indemnification,
contribution, assessment or otherwise), for any debts, obligations or
liabilities of, or chargeable to, the registered limited liability
partnership or another partner or partners, whether arising in tort,
contract or otherwise, solely by reason of being such a partner or
acting (or omitting to act) in such capacity or otherwise participating
(as an employee, consultant, contractor or otherwise) in the conduct of
the other business or activities of the registered limited liability
partnership, while the partnership is a registered limited liability
partnership.

(c)  Subsection (b) of this section shall not affect the liability of a
partner in a registered limited liability partnership for the partner's
own negligent or wrongful act or misconduct, or that of any person under
the partner's direct supervision and control.

(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section,
all or specified partners of a registered limited liability partnership
may be liable in their capacity as partners for all or specified debts,
obligations or liabilities of a registered limited liability partnership
to the extent at least a majority of the partners shall have agreed
unless otherwise provided in any agreement between the partners. Any
such agreement may be modified or revoked to the extent at least a
majority of the partners shall have agreed, unless otherwise provided in
any agreement between the partners, provided, however, that:

(i)  Any such modification or revocation shall not affect the liability
of a partner for any debts, obligations or liabilities of a registered
limited liability partnership incurred, created or assumed by the
registered limited liability partnership prior to the modification or
revocation; and

(ii)  A partner shall be liable for debts, obligations and liabilities
of the registered limited liability partnership incurred, created or
assumed after such modification or revocation only in accordance with
this article and, if the agreement is further modified, the agreement as
so further modified but only to the extent not inconsistent with
subsection (c) of this section.

(e)  Nothing in this section shall in any way affect or impair the
ability of a partner to act as a guarantor or surety for, provide
collateral for, or otherwise be liable for, the debts, obligations or
liabilities of a registered limited liability partnership.

(f)  Subsection (b) of this section shall not affect the liability of a
registered limited liability partnership out of partnership assets for
partnership debts, obligations and liabilities.

(g)  A partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not a
proper party to a proceeding by or against a registered limited
liability partnership, the object of which is to recover any debts,
obligations, or liabilities of, or chargeable to, the partnership,
unless the partner is personally liable under subsection (c) or (d) of
this section.

17‑21‑307.  Actions by and against partnership and partners.

(a)  A partnership may sue and be sued in the name of the partnership.

(b)  An action may be brought against the partnership and any or all of
the partners who are personally liable for obligations of the
partnership under W.S. 17‑21‑306 in the same action or in separate
actions.

(c)  A judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment
against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may not be satisfied
from a partner's assets unless there is a judgment against the partner.

(d)  A judgment creditor of a partner may not levy execution against the
assets of a partner to satisfy a judgment based on a claim against the
partnership unless:

(i)  The partner is personally liable for the liability of the
partnership under W.S. 17‑21‑306; and

(ii)  One (1) of the following conditions is satisfied:

(A)  A judgment based on the same claim has been obtained against the
partnership and a writ of execution on the judgment has been returned
unsatisfied in whole or in part;

(B)  An involuntary case under title 11 of the United States Code has
been commenced against the partnership and has not been dismissed within
sixty (60) days after commencement or the partnership has commenced a
voluntary case under title 11 of the United States Code and the case has
not been dismissed;

(C)  The partner has agreed that the creditor need not exhaust
partnership assets;

(D)  A court grants permission to the judgment creditor to levy
execution against the assets of a partner based on a finding that
partnership assets subject to execution are clearly insufficient to
satisfy the judgment, that exhaustion of partnership assets is
excessively burdensome or that the grant of permission is an appropriate
exercise of the court's equitable powers; or

(E)  Liability is imposed on the partner by law or contract independent
of the existence of the partnership.

(e)  This section applies to any partnership liability or obligation
resulting from a representation by a partner or purported partner under
W.S. 17‑21‑308(a) or (b).

17‑21‑308.  Purported partner.

(a)  If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner or
consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership
or with one (1) or more persons not partners, the purported partner is
liable to a person to whom the representation is made:

(i)  If that person, relying on the representation, enters into a
transaction with the actual or purported partnership; and

(ii)  If the purported partner would have been personally liable for
obligations of the partnership under W.S. 17‑21‑306 if he actually had
been a partner.

(b)  Subject to subsection (a) of this section if the representation,
either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported
partner's consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is
liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even if the
purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the
claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is
liable as if the purported partner were a partner. If no partnership
liability results, the purported partner is liable jointly and severally
with any other person consenting to the representation.

(c)  If a person is thus represented to be a partner in an existing
partnership or with one (1) or more persons not partners, the purported
partner is an agent of persons consenting to the representation to bind
them to the same extent and in the same manner as if the purported
partner were a partner, with respect to persons who enter into
transactions in reliance upon the representation. If all the partners of
the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership
act or obligation results. If fewer than all the partners of the
existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting
and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and
severally liable as provided in W.S. 17‑21‑306 as if the person actually
had been a partner.

(d)  A person is not a partner in a partnership solely because the
person is named by another in a statement of partnership authority.

(e)  A person does not continue to be a partner solely because of a
failure to file a statement of dissociation or to amend a statement of
partnership authority to indicate the partner's dissociation from the
partnership.

17‑21‑309.  Liability of incoming partner.

A person admitted as a partner into a partnership is liable for all
obligations of the partnership arising before the person's admission as
if the person had been a partner when the obligations were incurred, but
this liability may be satisfied only out of partnership property.

ARTICLE 4

RELATIONS OF PARTNERS TO EACH OTHER

AND TO PARTNERSHIP

17‑21‑401.  Partner's rights and duties.

(a)  A partnership shall establish an account for each partner which
shall be credited with an amount equal to the cash plus the value of any
other property, net of the amount of any liabilities, the partner
contributes to the partnership and the partner's share of the
partnership profits. Each partner's account shall be charged with an
amount equal to the cash plus the value of any other property, net of
the amount of any liabilities, distributed by the partnership to the
partner and the partner's share of the partnership losses provided that
the partner shall be personally liable on account of such charges only
as provided in W.S. 17‑21‑807 and 17‑21‑808.

(b)  A partnership shall credit each partner's account with an equal
share of the partnership profits and shall charge each partner with a
share of the partnership losses, whether capital or operating, as
provided in W.S. 17‑21‑808, in proportion to the partner's share of the
profits.

(c)  A partnership shall indemnify each partner for payments reasonably
made and liabilities reasonably incurred by the partner in the ordinary
and proper conduct of the business of the partnership or for the
preservation of its business or property, provided, however, that no
other partner shall be required to make any payment to the partnership
or any other partner, except as provided to the partnership or any other
partner, except as provided in W.S. 17‑21‑807 and 17‑21‑808, including
any payments attributable all or in part to partnership liabilities for
indemnification.

(d)  A partnership shall repay a partner who, in aid of the partnership,
makes a payment or advance beyond the amount of capital the partner
agreed to contribute.

(e)  A payment made by a partner which gives rise to a partnership
obligation under subsection (c) or (d) of this section constitutes a
loan to the partnership. Interest accrues from the date of the payment
or advance.

(f)  Each partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the
partnership business.

(g)  A partner may use or possess partnership property only on behalf of
the partnership.

(h)  A partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed
for the partnership, except for reasonable compensation for services
rendered in winding up the business of the partnership.

(j)  A person may become a partner only with the consent of all the
partners.

(k)  A difference arising as to a matter in the ordinary course of
business of a partnership may be decided by a majority of the partners.
An act outside the ordinary course of business of a partnership and an
amendment to the partnership agreement may be undertaken only with the
consent of all the partners.

(m)  This section does not affect the obligations of a partnership to
other persons under W.S. 17‑21‑301.

17‑21‑402.  Distributions in kind.

A partner has no right to receive and may not be required to accept a
distribution in kind.

17‑21‑403.  Partner's right to information.

(a)  A partnership shall keep its books and records, if any, at its
chief executive office.

(b)  A partnership shall provide partners and their agents and attorneys
access to its books and records. It shall provide former partners and
their agents and attorneys access to books and records pertaining to the
period during which they were partners. The right of access provides the
opportunity to inspect and copy books and records during ordinary
business hours. A partnership may impose a reasonable charge, covering
the costs of labor and material, for copies of documents furnished.

(c)  Each partner and the partnership, on demand, shall furnish to a
partner and the legal representative of a deceased partner or partner
under legal disability, to the extent just and reasonable, complete and
accurate information concerning the partnership.

17‑21‑404.  General standards of partner's conduct.

(a)  The only fiduciary duties a partner owes to the partnership and the
other partners are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care set forth in
this section.

(b)  A partner's duty of loyalty to the partnership and the other
partners is limited to the following:

(i)  To account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any
property, profit or benefit derived by the partner, without the consent
of the other partners, in the conduct and winding up of the partnership
business or from a use or appropriation by the partner of partnership
property or opportunity;

(ii)  To refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or
winding up of the partnership business, as or on behalf of a party
having an interest adverse to the partnership without the consent of the
other partners; and

(iii)  To refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of
the partnership business without the consent of the other partners
before the dissolution of the partnership.

(c)  A partner's duty of loyalty may not be eliminated by agreement, but
the partners may by agreement identify specific types or categories of
activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty, if not manifestly
unreasonable.

(d)  A partner's duty of care to the partnership and the other partners
in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business is limited to
refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct,
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.

(e)  A partner shall discharge the duties to the partnership and the
other partners under this chapter or under the partnership agreement,
and exercise any rights, consistent with the obligation of good faith
and fair dealing. The obligation of good faith and fair dealing may not
be eliminated by agreement but the partners may by agreement determine
the standards by which the performance of the obligation is to be
measured, if the standards are not manifestly unreasonable.

(f)  A partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter
or under the partnership agreement merely because the partner's conduct
furthers the partner's own interest. A partner may lend money to and
transact other business with the partnership. The rights and obligations
of a partner who lends money to or transacts business with the
partnership are the same as those of a person who is not a partner,
subject to other applicable law.

(g)  This section applies to a person winding up the partnership
business as the personal or legal representative of the last surviving
partner as if the person were a partner.

17‑21‑405.  Partner's liability to partnership.

A partner is liable to the partnership for a breach of the partnership
agreement or for the violation of any duty to the partnership causing
harm to the partnership.

17‑21‑406.  Remedies of partnership and partners.

(a)  A partnership may maintain an action against a partner for a breach
of the partnership agreement or for the violation of any duty to the
partnership causing harm to the partnership.

(b)  A partner may maintain an action against the partnership or another
partner for legal or equitable relief, including an accounting as to
partnership business, to:

(i)  Enforce a right under the partnership agreement;

(ii)  Enforce a right under this chapter, including:

(A)  The partner's rights under W.S. 17‑21‑401, 17‑21‑403 and 17‑21‑404;

(B)  The partner's right on dissociation to have the partner's interest
in the partnership purchased pursuant to W.S. 17‑21‑701 or enforce any
other right under article 6 or 7 of this chapter; or

(C)  The partner's right to compel a dissolution and winding up of the
partnership business under W.S. 17‑21‑801 or enforce any other right
under article 8 of this chapter.

(iii)  Enforce the rights and otherwise protect the interests of the
partner, including rights and interests arising independently of the
partnership relationship.

(c)  The accrual of and any time limitation on a right of action for a
remedy under this section is governed by other law. A right to an
accounting upon a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim
barred by law.

17‑21‑407.  Continuation of partnership beyond definite term or
particular undertaking.

(a)  If a partnership for a definite term or particular undertaking is
continued, without an express agreement, after the expiration of the
term or completion of the undertaking, the rights and duties of the
partners remain the same as they were at the expiration or completion,
so far as is consistent with a partnership at will.

(b)  A continuation of the business by the partners or those of them who
habitually acted in the business during the term or undertaking, without
any settlement or liquidation of the partnership business, is prima
facie evidence of an agreement that the business will not be wound up.

ARTICLE 5

TRANSFEREES AND CREDITORS OF PARTNER

17‑21‑501.  Partner's interest in partnership property not transferable.

A partner is not a co‑owner of partnership property and has no interest
that can be transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily, in
partnership property.

17‑21‑502.  Partner's transferable interest in partnership.

(a)  The only transferable interest of a partner in the partnership is
the partner's interest in distributions. The interest is personal
property.

(b)  A transferee of a partner's transferable interest in the
partnership has the right to cause a winding up of the partnership
business as provided in W.S. 17‑21‑801(a)(vi).

17‑21‑503.  Transfer of partner's transferable interest.

(a)  A transfer, in whole or in part, of a partner's transferable
interest in the partnership:

(i)  Is permissible;

(ii)  Does not by itself cause a winding up of the partnership business;
and

(iii)  Does not, as against the other partners or the partnership,
entitle the transferee, during the continuance of the partnership, to
participate in the management or conduct of the partnership business, to
require access to information concerning or an account of partnership
transactions or to inspect or copy the partnership books or records.

(b)  A transferee of a partner's transferable interest in the
partnership is entitled to receive, in accordance with the transfer,
distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled. Upon
transfer, the transferor retains the rights and duties of a partner
other than the interest in distributions transferred.

(c)  If an event causes a dissolution and winding up of the partnership
business under W.S. 17‑21‑801, a transferee is entitled to receive, in
accordance with the transfer, the net amount otherwise distributable to
the transferor. In a dissolution and winding up, a transferee may
require an accounting only from the date of the last account agreed to
by all of the partners.

(d)  Until receipt of notice of a transfer, a partnership has no duty to
give effect to the transferee's rights under this section.

17‑21‑504.  Partner's transferable interest subject to charging order.

(a)  On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or partner's
transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the transferable
interest of the debtor partner or transferee to satisfy the judgment.
The court may appoint a receiver of the debtor's share of the
distributions due or to become due to the debtor in respect of the
partnership and make all other orders, directions, accounts and
inquiries the debtor might have made or which the circumstances of the
case may require.

(b)  A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's
transferable interest in the partnership. The court may order a
foreclosure of the interest subject to the charging order at any time
and upon conditions it considers appropriate. The purchaser at the
foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.

(c)  At any time before foreclosure, an interest charged may be
redeemed:

(i)  By the judgment debtor;

(ii)  With property other than partnership property by one (1) or more
of the other partners; or

(iii)  With partnership property by one (1) or more of the other
partners with the consent of all the partners whose interests are not so
charged.

(d)  This chapter does not deprive a partner of a right under exemption
laws with respect to the partner's interest in the partnership.

(e)  This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment
creditor of a partner or partner's transferee may satisfy a judgment out
of the judgment debtor's transferable interest in the partnership.

agreement; or

(ii)  In the case of a partnership for a definite term or particular
undertaking, before the expiration of the term or the completion of the

ARTICLE 7

PARTNER'S DISSOCIATION WHEN BUSINESS NOT WOUND UP

17‑21‑701.  Purchase of dissociated partner's interest.

(a)  If a partner is dissociated from a partnership without resulting in
a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under W.S.
17‑21‑801, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner's
interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price
determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

(b)  The buyout price of a dissociated partner's interest is the amount
that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under
W.S. 17‑21‑808(b) if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the
partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation
value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going
concern without the dissociated partner and the partnership were wound
up as of that date. In either case, the sale price of the partnership
assets shall be determined on the basis of the amount that would be paid
by a willing buyer to a willing seller, neither being under any
compulsion to buy or sell, and with knowledge of all relevant facts.
Interest shall be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of
payment.

(c)  Damages for wrongful dissociation under W.S. 17‑21‑602(b) and all
other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the dissociated
partner to the partnership, shall be offset against the buyout price.
Interest shall be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the
date of payment.

(d)  A partnership shall indemnify a dissociated partner against all
partnership liabilities incurred before the dissociation, except
liabilities then unknown to the partnership, and against all partnership
liabilities incurred after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred
by an act of the dissociated partner under W.S. 17‑21‑702. For purposes
of this subsection, a liability not known to a partner other than the
dissociated partner is not known to the partnership.

(e)  If no agreement for the purchase of a dissociated partner's
interest is reached within one hundred twenty (120) days after a written
demand for payment, the partnership shall pay or cause to be paid in
cash to the dissociated partner the amount the partnership estimates to
be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and
accrued interest under subsection (c) of this section.

(f)  If a deferred payment is authorized under subsection (h) of this
section, the partnership may tender a written offer to pay the amount it
estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any
offsets under subsection (c) of this section, stating the time of
payment, the amount and type of security for payment and the other terms
and conditions of the obligation.

(g)  The payment or tender required by subsection (e) or (f) of this
section shall be accompanied by the following:

(i)  A statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of
dissociation;

(ii)  The latest available partnership balance sheet and income
statement, if any;

(iii)  An explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was
calculated; and

(iv)  Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the
obligation to purchase unless, within one hundred twenty (120) days
after the written notice, the dissociated partner commences an action to
determine the buyout price, any offsets under subsection (c) of this
section or other terms of the purchase obligation.

(h)  A partner who wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a
definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not
entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the
expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the
partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier
payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the
partnership. A deferred payment shall be adequately secured and bear
interest.

(j)  A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the
partnership pursuant to W.S. 17‑21‑406(b)(ii)(B), to determine the
buyout price of that partner's interest, any offsets under subsection
(c) of this section or other terms of the purchase obligation. The
action shall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one (1)
year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is
tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated
partner's interest, any offset due under subsection (c) of this section
and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or
refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (h) of this
section, the court shall also determine the security for payment and
other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess
reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or
other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds
equitable, against any other party, if the court finds that the other
party acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith, including the
partnership's failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply
with the requirements of subsection (g) of this section.

17‑21‑702.  Dissociated partner's power to bind and liability to
partnership.

(a)  For two (2) years after a partner dissociates without resulting in
a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, the
partnership, including a surviving partnership under article 9 of this
chapter, is bound by an act of the dissociated partner that would have
bound the partnership under W.S. 17‑21‑301 before dissociation only if
the other party to the transaction:

(i)  Reasonably believes when entering the transaction that the
dissociated partner is a partner at that time;

(ii)  Does not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and

(iii)  Is not deemed to have notice under W.S. 17‑21‑303(e) or
17‑21‑704.

(b)  A dissociated partner is liable to the partnership for any loss
caused to the partnership arising from an obligation incurred by the
dissociated partner after dissociation, for which the partnership is
liable under subsection (a) of this section.

17‑21‑703.  Dissociated partner's liability to other persons.

(a)  A partner's dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner's
liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation. A
dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred
after dissociation except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.

(b)  A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and
winding up of the partnership business is personally liable as a partner
to the other party on account of a partnership obligation incurred in
connection with a transaction entered into by the partnership or a
surviving partnership under article 9 of this chapter, within two (2)
years after the partner's dissociation, only if:

(i)  The other party to the transaction:

(A)  Reasonably believes when entering the transaction that the
dissociated partner is a partner at that time;

(B)  Does not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and

(C)  Is not deemed to have notice under W.S. 17‑21‑303(e) or 17‑21‑704;
and

(ii)  The obligation is one on account of which the partner would be
personally liable under W.S. 17‑21‑306 if the partner had not
dissociated.

(c)  By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners
continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from
liability for a partnership obligation.

(d)  A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership
obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner's
dissociation but without the partner's consent, agrees to a material
alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.

17‑21‑704.  Statement of dissociation.

(a)  A dissociated partner or the partnership may file a statement of
dissociation stating the name of the partnership and that the partner is
dissociated from the partnership. A statement of dissociation is a
limitation on the authority of a dissociated partner for the purposes of
W.S. 17‑21‑303(d) and (e).

(b)  For purposes of W.S. 17‑21‑702 and 17‑21‑703(b), a person not a
partner is deemed to have notice of the dissociation ninety (90) days
after the statement of dissociation is filed.

17‑21‑705.  Continued use of partnership name.

Continued use of a partnership name, or a dissociated partner's name as
part thereof, by the partners continuing the business does not of itself
make the dissociated partner liable for an obligation of the partners or
the partnership continuing the business.

ARTICLE 8

17‑21‑801.  Events causing dissolution and winding up of partnership
business.

(a)  A partnership is dissolved and its business shall be wound up only

winding up of the partnership business, unless all the partners agree to
continue the business, in which case the partnership agreement is deemed
amended retroactively to provide that the event does not result in the

(iv)  An event that makes it unlawful for all or substantially all of

(v)  On application by a partner, a judicial decree that:

transfer or entry of the charging order that gave rise to the transfer,
at any time.

17‑21‑802.  Dissolution deferred ninety days.

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a partnership
of more than two (2) persons is not dissolved until ninety (90) days
after receipt by the partnership of notice from a partner under W.S.
17‑21‑801(a)(i) or (ii)(A) and its business may be continued until that
date as if no notice were received. Before that date, the partner who
gave the notice may waive the right to have the partnership business
wound up. If there is no waiver before that date, the partnership is
dissolved and its business must be wound up.

(b)  A partnership may be dissolved at any time during the ninety (90)
day period and its business wound up by the express will of at least
one-half (1/2) of the other partners.

(c)  After receipt by the partnership of notice from a partner under
W.S. 17‑21‑801(a)(i) or (ii)(A), the partner who gave the notice:

(i)  Has no rights in the management and conduct of the partnership
business if it is continued under subsection (a) of this section, but

indemnified by the other partners against any partnership liability
incurred by another partner to the extent the liability is not
appropriate for winding up the partnership business; and

(iii)  With respect to profits or losses incurred during the period,
shall be credited with a share of any profits but shall be charged with
a share of any losses only to the extent of profits credited for the
period.

17‑21‑803.  Partnership continues after dissolution.

A partnership continues after dissolution until the winding up of its
business is completed, at which time the partnership is terminated.

17‑21‑804.  Right to wind up partnership business.

(a)  After dissolution, a partner who has not wrongfully dissociated has
a right to participate in winding up the partnership's business, but on
application of any partner, partner's legal representative or
transferee, the court, for good cause, may order judicial supervision of
the winding up.

(b)  The legal representative of the last surviving partner may wind up
a partnership's business.

(c)  A person winding up a partnership's business may preserve the

17‑21‑805.  Partner's power to bind partnership after dissolution.

(a)  Subject to W.S. 17‑21‑806, a partnership is bound by a partner's
act after dissolution that:

(i)  Is appropriate for winding up the partnership business; or

(ii)  Would have bound the partnership under W.S. 17‑21‑301 before
dissolution, if the other party to the transaction does not have notice
of the dissolution.

17‑21‑806.  Statement of dissolution.

(a)  After dissolution, a partner who has not wrongfully dissociated may
file a statement of dissolution stating the name of the partnership and
that the partnership has dissolved and is winding up its business.

(b)  A statement of dissolution cancels a filed statement of partnership
authority for the purposes of W.S. 17‑21‑303(d) and is a limitation on
authority for the purposes of W.S. 17‑21‑303(e).

(c)  For purposes of W.S. 17‑21‑301 and 17‑21‑805, a person not a
partner is deemed to have notice of the dissolution and the limitation
on the partners' authority as a result of the statement of dissolution
ninety (90) days after it is filed.

(d)  After filing and where appropriate, recording a statement of
dissolution, the dissolved partnership may file and where appropriate,
record a statement of partnership authority which shall operate with
respect to a person not a partner as provided in W.S. 17‑21‑303(d) and
(e) in any transaction, whether or not the transaction is appropriate
for winding up the partnership business.

17‑21‑807.  Partner's liability to other partners after dissolution.

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section and W.S.
17‑21‑802(c)(ii), after dissolution a partner is liable to the other
partners for the partner's share of any partnership liability incurred
under W.S. 17‑21‑805 for which the partner is personally liable under
W.S. 17‑21‑306.

(b)  A partner who, with knowledge of the winding up, incurs a
partnership liability under W.S. 17‑21‑805(a)(ii) by an act that is not
appropriate for winding up the partnership business is liable to the
partnership for any loss caused to the partnership arising from that
liability.

17‑21‑808.  Settlement of accounts among partners.

(a)  In winding up the partnership business, the assets of the
partnership shall be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors,
including partners who are creditors. Any surplus shall be applied to
pay in cash the net amount distributable to partners in accordance with
their right to distributions pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

(b)  Each partner is entitled to a settlement of all partnership
accounts upon winding up the partnership business. In settling accounts
among the partners, the profits and losses that result from the
liquidation of the partnership assets shall be credited and charged to
the partners' accounts. The partnership shall make a distribution to a
partner in an amount equal to that partner's positive balance. A partner
shall contribute to the partnership an amount equal to that partner's
negative balance only to the extent that negative balance is
attributable to an obligation for which that partner is personally
liable under W.S. 17‑21‑306.

(c)  To the extent not taken into account in settling the accounts among
partners pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, each partner shall
contribute in the proportion in which the partner shares partnership
losses, the amount necessary to satisfy those partnership obligations
for which the partner is personally liable under W.S. 17‑21‑306. If a
partner fails or is not obligated to contribute, the other partners
shall contribute in the proportions in which the partners share
partnership losses, the additional amount necessary to satisfy those
partnership obligations for which the partners are personally liable
under W.S. 17‑21‑306. A partner or partner's legal representative may
recover from the other partners any contributions the partner makes to
the extent the amount contributed exceeds that partner's share of the
partnership obligations but only to the extent such contributions are
made on account of obligations for which the other partners are liable
under W.S. 17‑21‑306.

(d)  The estate of a deceased partner is liable for the partner's
obligation to contribute to the partnership under subsection (b) of this
section.

(e)  An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a partnership or a
partner or a person appointed by the court to represent creditors of a
partnership or a partner, may enforce a partner's obligation to
contribute to the partnership under subsection (b) of this section.

surviving entity upon filing a statement of merger.

(d)  For purposes of W.S. 17‑21‑302, real property of the surviving

partners authorized to execute a statement of registration. The
statement of registration shall be accompanied by a written consent to
appointment manually signed by the registered agent.

(c)  Repealed By Laws 2000, Ch. 35, § 2.

(d)  The secretary of state shall register as a registered limited
liability partnership any partnership that submits a statement of
registration that substantially complies with this section and the
required fee.

(e)  Repealed By Laws 2000, Ch. 35, § 2.

(f)  Registration is effective immediately upon the filing of a
statement of registration or at any later date or time specified in the
statement of registration, and remains effective until:

(i)  It is voluntarily withdrawn by filing with the office of the
secretary of state a written statement of withdrawal executed by one (1)
or more partners authorized to execute a statement of withdrawal; or

(ii)  Sixty (60) days after notice by the secretary of state that the
partnership has failed to make timely payment of the annual fee
specified in subsection (n) of this section or has failed to pay any
penalties imposed under W.S. 17‑28‑109, unless the fee and any penalties
are paid within the sixty (60) day period, or that the partnership is
without a registered agent or registered office in this state, unless
the partnership regains a registered agent or registered office in this
state during the sixty (60) day period. The secretary of state shall
mail such notice by first class mail to the last known mailing address
of the partnership or by electronic means if the partnership has
consented to receive notices electronically. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this paragraph, any domestic registered limited liability
partnership whose statement of registration has lapsed under this
paragraph may be reinstated as provided in W.S. 17‑21‑1107.

(g)  A registered limited liability partnership registered under this
chapter ceases to be a registered limited liability partnership upon
filing with the office of the secretary of state a statement of
withdrawal as a registered limited liability partnership, which shall

(ii)  The date of filing of the initial statement of registration;

(iii)  The reason for filing the statement of withdrawal;

(iv)  The effective date (which shall be a date certain) of withdrawal

withdrawal, provided that any effective date other than the date of
filing of the statement of withdrawal shall be a date subsequent to the
filing; and

(v)  Any other information the partners determine to include therein.

(h)  The filing of a statement of withdrawal by or on behalf of a
partnership pursuant to this section shall be effective only to cancel
the partnership's registration as a limited liability partnership, and
shall not, unless it specifically so provides, indicate the dissolution
of the partnership.

(j)  A partnership becomes a registered limited liability partnership at
the time of the filing of the initial statement of registration with the
office of the secretary of state or at any later date or time specified
in the statement of registration if, in either case, there has been
substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter. A
partnership continues as a registered limited liability partnership if
there has been substantial compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. The status of a partnership as a registered limited liability
partnership and the liability of a partner of such registered limited
liability partnership shall not be affected by errors or subsequent
changes in the information stated in a statement of registration under
subsection (a) of this section or a statement of renewal under
subsection (e) of this section. The filing of a statement of withdrawal
shall not affect the liability of the partners for debts, obligations or
liabilities of the partnership incurred, assumed or arising prior to the
date of the statement of withdrawal.

(k)  The fact that a statement of registration or a statement of renewal
is on file with the office of the secretary of state is notice that the
partnership is a registered limited liability partnership and is notice

registration under subsection (a) of this section or a statement of
renewal.

liability partnership and foreign limited liability partnership shall
annually comply with and pay the fees provided by W.S. 17‑16‑1630(a)
through (e) and 17‑16‑120(j) as if it were a corporation. Any registered
foreign limited liability partnership transacting business in this state
without registering or annually maintaining its registration is subject
to the penalties provided by W.S. 17‑16‑1502(d).

(o)  The provisions of W.S. 17‑28‑101 through 17‑28‑111 shall apply to
all registered limited liability partnerships.

17‑21‑1102.  Effect of registration; entity unchanged.

(a)  A partnership that has registered pursuant to this article is for
all purposes of the laws of this state the same entity that existed
before the registration.

(b)  When registration takes effect:

(i)  All property owned by the registering partnership remains vested in
the registered partnership;

(ii)  All obligations of the registering partnership continue as
obligations of the registered partnership; and

(iii)  An action or proceeding pending against the registering
partnership may be continued as if the registration had not occurred.

(c)  If a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered
limited liability partnership dissolves and its business continues
without winding up the partnership affairs and without liquidating or
terminating the partnership, the registration of the registered limited
liability partnership or the foreign registered limited liability
partnership shall continue to be applicable to the partnership
continuing the business, and the partnership shall not be required to
file a new statement of registration or statement of renewal. The
partnership continuing the business shall be deemed to have filed any
documents required or permitted under this section which were filed by
the dissolved partnership. The partnership continuing the business shall
file a statement of renewal at such time as the dissolved partnership
would have been required to file a statement of renewal.

(d)  If a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered
limited liability partnership dissolves and winds up its affairs,
liquidates or terminates, the statement of registration or statement of
renewal remains in effect as to the partnership and the partners during
the period of winding up, and as to the partners subsequent to
liquidation or termination as to liabilities of the partnership
incurred, assumed or arising prior to liquidation or termination.

17‑21‑1103.  Name of registered limited liability partnership; limited
rights.

(a)  The name of a registered limited liability partnership shall not be
the same as or deceptively similar to any trademark or service mark
registered in this state, shall be distinguishable upon the records of
the secretary of state from other business names filed with that office
and must end with "Registered Limited Liability Partnership", "Limited
Liability Partnership", "R.L.L.P.", "L.L.P.", "RLLP", or "LLP".

(b)  The authorization granted by the secretary of state to file a
statement of registration under a registered limited liability
partnership name does not:

(i)  Abrogate or limit the law governing unfair competition or unfair
trade practices;

(ii)  Derogate from the common law the principles of equity or the
statutes of this state or of the United States with respect to the right
to acquire and protect names and trademarks; or

(iii)  Create an exclusive right in geographic or generic terms
contained within a name.

17‑21‑1104.  Applicability of act to foreign and interstate commerce.

partnership, formed pursuant to an agreement governed by this chapter,
may conduct its business, carry on its operations and have and exercise
the powers granted by this chapter in any state, territory, district or
possession of the United States or in any foreign country.

(b)  It is the intent of the legislature that the legal existence of
registered limited liability partnerships formed pursuant to an
agreement governed by this chapter be recognized outside the boundaries
of this state and that the laws of this state governing such registered
limited liability partnerships transacting business outside this state
be granted the protection of full faith and credit under the
constitution of the United States.

(c)  Notwithstanding W.S. 17‑21‑106, the internal affairs of registered
limited liability partnerships, including the liability of partners for
debts, obligations and liabilities of or chargeable to the partnership
or another partner or partners and the liability of partners to the
partnership and other partners, shall be subject to and governed by the
laws of this state.

(d)  Before transacting business in this state, a foreign registered
limited liability partnership shall:

(i)  Comply with any statutory or administrative registration or filing
requirements governing the specific type of business in which the
partnership is engaged; and

(ii)  File a statement of registration as a foreign registered limited
liability partnership with the office of the secretary of state, on such
forms as the secretary shall provide, stating:

(A)  The name of the partnership;

(B)  The jurisdiction under the laws of which govern its partnership
agreement and under which it is registered as a limited liability
partnership;

(C)  The address of its principal office which, if in this state, shall
be its registered office for service of process;

registered agent for service of process in this state, which the
partnership will be required to maintain;

foreign registered limited liability partnership by filing with the

registered limited liability partnership, which shall set forth:

(i)  The name of the foreign registered limited liability partnership
and the state or other jurisdiction under whose jurisdiction it is or
was registered as a registered limited liability partnership;

(ii)  That the foreign registered limited liability partnership is not
transacting business in this state and that it surrenders its
registration to transact business in this state;

(iii)  That the foreign registered limited liability partnership revokes
the authority of its registered agent in this state to accept service of
process and appoints the secretary of state as its agent for service of
process in any action, suit or proceeding based upon any cause of action
arising during the time the foreign registered limited liability
partnership was registered to transact business in this state; and

(iv)  A mailing address to which the secretary of state may mail a copy
of any process served on him in his capacity as agent for such
registered limited liability partnership.

(g)  The failure of a foreign registered limited liability partnership
to file a statement of registration or a statement of renewal pursuant
to W.S. 17‑21‑1101 or to appoint and maintain a registered agent in this
state shall not affect the liability of the partners or impair the
validity of any contract or act of the foreign registered limited
liability partnership and shall not prevent the foreign registered
limited liability partnership from defending any action or proceeding in
any court of this state, but the foreign registered limited liability
partnership shall not maintain any action or proceeding in any court of
this state until it has filed a statement of registration. A foreign
registered limited liability partnership, by transacting business in
this state without registration, appoints the secretary of state as its
agent for service of process with respect to causes of action arising
out of the transaction of business in this state.

(h)  The name of a foreign registered limited liability partnership
doing business in this state shall not be the same as or deceptively
similar to any trademark or service mark registered in this state and
shall be distinguishable upon the records of the secretary of state from
other business names filed with that office. A foreign limited liability
partnership must use a name which satisfies the requirements of the
state or other jurisdiction under whose law it is formed and ends with
"Registered Limited Liability Partnership", "Limited Liability
Partnership", "R.L.L.P.", "L.L.P.", "RLLP", or "LLP".

(j)  The laws under which a foreign limited liability partnership is
formed govern relations among the partners and between the partners and
the partnership and the liability of partners for obligations of the
partnership.

statement of registration under a foreign registered limited liability
partnership name does not:

(i)  Abrogate or limit the law governing unfair competition or unfair

statutes of this state or of the United States with respect to the right
to acquire and protect names and trademarks; or

(iii)  Create an exclusive right in geographic or generic terms
contained within a name.

(m)  Failure of a foreign registered limited liability partnership to
make timely payment of the annual fee specified in W.S. 17‑21‑1101(n) or
to pay any penalties imposed under W.S. 17‑28‑109 shall result in the
statement of registration being revoked by the secretary of state
pursuant to W.S. 17‑21‑1101(f).

(n)  A foreign registered limited liability partnership whose
registration has lapsed for failure to pay fees or failure to maintain a
registered agent in this state as provided in this article may apply to
the secretary of state for reinstatement within two (2) years after the
effective date of lapse as provided in W.S. 17‑21‑1107.

17‑21‑1105.  Registered limited liability partnership by licensed
persons.

Nothing in this act shall be interpreted as precluding an individual
whose occupation requires licensure under Wyoming law or the law of
another jurisdiction from forming a registered limited liability
partnership if the applicable licensing statutes do not prohibit it and
the licensing body does not prohibit it by rule or regulation adopted
consistent with the appropriate licensing statute. Each licensed
professional offering professional services through a registered limited
liability partnership shall retain their professional license in good
standing and shall be subject to all rules, regulations, standards and
requirements pertaining thereto.

17‑21‑1106.  Statement of continuance.

partnerships acting as an insurer as defined in W.S. 26‑1‑102(a)(xvi) or
acting as a financial institution as defined in W.S. 13‑1‑101(a)(ix),

(a)  As used in this chapter:

(i)  "Beneficial owner" means any owner of a beneficial interest in a
statutory trust. The fact of ownership shall be determined and
evidenced, whether by means of registration, the issuance of
certificates or otherwise, in conformity to the applicable provisions of
the governing instrument of the statutory trust;

(ii)  "Governing instrument" means a trust instrument which creates a
statutory trust and provides for the governance of the affairs of the
statutory trust and the conduct of its business. A governing instrument
may:

(A)  Provide that a person shall become a beneficial owner and shall
become bound by the governing instrument if the person, or a
representative authorized by the person orally, in writing or by other
action such as payment for a beneficial interest, complies with the
conditions for becoming a beneficial owner set forth in the governing
instrument or any other writing and acquires a beneficial interest; and

(B)  Consist of one (1) or more agreements, instruments or other
writings and may include or incorporate bylaws containing provisions
relating to the business of the statutory trust, the conduct of its
affairs and its rights or powers or the rights or powers of its
trustees, beneficial owners, agents or employees.

(iii)  "Other business entity" means a corporation, a partnership, a
limited partnership, a limited liability company, a common‑law trust or
any other unincorporated business, excluding a statutory trust;

limited liability company, trust, estate, association, corporation,
custodian, nominee or any other individual or entity in its own or any
representative capacity;

(v)  "Statutory trust" means an unincorporated association which:

held, managed, administered, controlled, invested, reinvested or
operated, or business or professional activities for profit are carried
on or will be carried on, by a trustee or trustees for the benefit of a
person who is or may become entitled to a beneficial interest in the
trust property, including but not limited to a trust of the type known
at common law as a "business trust," "Massachusetts trust," a trust
qualifying as a real estate investment trust under sections 856 through
859 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
under any successor provision, or a trust qualifying as a real estate
mortgage investment conduit under section 860D of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or under any successor

(B)  Files a certificate of trust pursuant to W.S. 17‑23‑114. Any
association meeting the definition of this paragraph whether organized
before or after the effective date of this chapter shall be a statutory
trust and a separate legal entity.

(vi)  "Trustee" means the person or persons appointed as a trustee in
accordance with the governing instrument of a statutory trust, and may
include the beneficial owners or any of them.

17‑23‑103.  Purpose.

purpose, except acting as an insurer as defined in W.S.
26‑1‑102(a)(xvi), or acting as a financial institution as defined by
W.S. 13‑1‑101(a)(ix) or its successor statute, whether or not conducted
for profit, or for any of the purposes referred to in W.S.
17‑23‑102(a)(v)(A) including, without limitation, for the purpose of
holding or otherwise taking title to property, whether in an active or
custodial capacity.

17‑23‑104.  Contributions by beneficial owners.

(a)  A contribution of a beneficial owner to the statutory trust may be
in cash, property or services rendered, or a promissory note or other
obligation to contribute cash or property or to perform services. A
person may become a beneficial owner of a statutory trust and may
receive a beneficial interest in a statutory trust without making a
contribution or being obligated to make a contribution to the statutory
trust.

(b)  Except as provided in the governing instrument, a beneficial owner
is obligated to the statutory trust to perform any promise to contribute
cash, property or to perform services, even if the beneficial owner is
unable to perform because of death, disability or any other reason. If a
beneficial owner does not make the required contribution of property or
services, the beneficial owner is obligated at the option of the
statutory trust to contribute cash equal to that portion of the agreed
value, as stated in the records of the statutory trust, of the
contribution that has not been made. The cash contribution shall be in
addition to any other rights, including the right to specific
performance, that the statutory trust may have against the beneficial
owner under the governing instrument or applicable law.

(c)  A governing instrument may provide that the interest of any
beneficial owner who fails to make any contribution that he is obligated
to make shall be subject to specific penalties or consequences for the
failure. The penalty or consequence may take the form of:

(i)  Reducing or eliminating the defaulting beneficial owner's
proportionate interest in the statutory trust;

beneficial owners;

(iii)  A forced sale of his beneficial interest;

(iv)  Forfeiture of his beneficial interest;

(v)  The lending by other beneficial owners of the amount necessary to
meet his commitment;

(vi)  Fixing of the value of his beneficial interest by appraisal or by
formula and redemption or sale of his beneficial interest at that value;
or

(vii)  Any other penalty or consequence.

17‑23‑105.  Liability of beneficial owners and trustees.

(a)  Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing
instrument, the beneficial owner shall be entitled to any limitations of
personal liability extended to shareholders of private corporations for
profit organized under the Wyoming Business Corporation Act or extended
to members of limited liability companies organized under the Wyoming
Limited Liability Company Act.

(b)  Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing
instrument, a trustee, when acting in that capacity, shall not be
personally liable to any persons other than the statutory trust or a
beneficial owner for any act, omission or obligation of the statutory
trust or any trustee. Notwithstanding the provisions of W.S. 17‑23‑113,
trustees of a statutory trust shall not be held to a more rigorous
standard of care than that imposed upon directors of a business
corporation under the Wyoming Business Corporation Act.

17‑23‑106.  Legal proceedings.

(a)  A statutory trust may sue and be sued in its own name, and service
of process upon any one (1) of the trustees or upon the registered agent
shall be sufficient. A statutory trust may be sued for debts and other
obligations or liabilities contracted or incurred by the trustees, or by
the duly authorized agents of the trustees, in the performance of their
respective duties under the governing instrument of the statutory trust,
and for any damages to persons or property resulting from the negligence
of the trustees or agents acting in the performance of their respective
duties. The property of a statutory trust shall be subject to attachment
and execution pursuant to the Wyoming Code of Civil Procedure, as if it
were a corporation.

(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section,
in the event that the governing instrument of a statutory trust which is
a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, creates one (1) or more series as provided in W.S.
17‑23‑108(b)(ii), the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses
incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a
particular series shall be enforceable against the assets of that series
only, and not against the assets of the statutory trust generally if:

(i)  Separate and distinct records are maintained for the series;

(ii)  The assets associated with the series are held and accounted for
separately from the other assets of the statutory trust, or any other
series of that trust; and

(iii)  The governing instrument so provides, and notice of the
limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in this subsection
is set forth in the certificate of trust of the statutory trust.

(c)  A trustee of a statutory trust may be served with process in the
manner prescribed in subsection (d) of this section in all civil actions
or proceedings brought in this state involving or relating to the
activities of the statutory trust or a violation by a trustee of a duty
to the statutory trust, or any beneficial owner, whether or not the
trustee is a trustee at the time suit is commenced. Every resident or
nonresident of the state who accepts election or appointment or serves
as a trustee of a statutory trust shall, by the acceptance or service,
have consented to the appointment of the registered agent of the
statutory trust required by W.S. 17‑23‑109 as that person's agent upon
whom service of process may be made as provided in this section. Any
process served in accordance with this section shall be of the same
legal force and validity as if served upon the trustee within the state
and the appointment of the registered agent shall be irrevocable.

(d)  Service of process shall be effected by serving a Wyoming trustee
or registered agent of the statutory trust required by W.S. 17‑23‑109,
with one (1) copy of the process in the manner provided by law for
service of process.

(e)  In the governing instrument or other writing, a trustee may consent
to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or
arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction
of the courts of, or the exclusivity of arbitration in, this state, and
to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in the
governing instrument or other writing.

(f)  Nothing in this section limits or affects the right to serve
process in any other manner provided by law. This section is an
extension of and not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of
service of legal process upon nonresidents.

(g)  A partnership, limited partnership, corporation, limited liability
company or other nonnatural person formed or organized under the laws of
any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction or the laws of any
state other than the state of Wyoming shall not be deemed to be doing
business in the state solely by reason of its being a trustee of a
statutory trust.

17‑23‑107.  Rights of beneficial owners in trust property.

(a)  Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing
instrument, a beneficial owner shall have an undivided beneficial
interest in the property of the statutory trust and shall share in the
profits or losses of the statutory trust in the proportion of the entire
undivided beneficial interest in the statutory trust he owns. The
governing instrument of a statutory trust may provide that the statutory
trust or the trustees, acting for and on behalf of the statutory trust,
shall be deemed to hold beneficial ownership of any income earned on
securities of the statutory trust issued by any business entities
formed, organized or existing under the laws of any jurisdiction,
including the laws of any foreign country.

(b)  No creditor of the beneficial owner shall have any right to obtain
possession of, or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with
respect to, the property of the statutory trust.

(c)  A beneficial owner's beneficial interest in the statutory trust is
personal property notwithstanding the nature of the property of the
trust. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing
instrument, a beneficial owner has no interest in specific statutory
trust property.

(d)  Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing
instrument, the transferee of a beneficial owner's beneficial interest
in the statutory trust shall only be entitled to receive the share of
profits and the return of contributions to which the beneficial owner
otherwise would be entitled. In the absence of the unanimous written
consent of the owners of all other beneficial interests and of all
trustees of the statutory trust, and except to the extent otherwise
provided in the governing instrument, a transferee of a beneficial
owner's beneficial interest shall have no right to participate in, be
kept apprised of the affairs of the statutory trust or to become a
beneficial owner of a beneficial interest in the statutory trust.

(e)  Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing
instrument, at the time a beneficial owner becomes entitled to receive a
distribution, he has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies
available to, a creditor of the statutory trust with respect to the
distribution. A governing instrument may provide for the establishment
of record dates with respect to allocations and distributions by a
statutory trust.

17‑23‑108.  Management of statutory trust.

(a)  The business and affairs of a statutory trust shall be managed by
or under the direction of its trustees. To the extent provided in the
governing instrument, any person, including a beneficial owner, shall be
entitled to direct the trustees in the management of a statutory trust.
Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument,
neither the power to give direction to a trustee nor the exercise
thereof by any person, including a beneficial owner, shall cause the
person to be a trustee.

(b)  A governing instrument may contain any provision relating to the
management of the business and affairs of the statutory trust, and the
rights, duties and obligations of the trustees, beneficial owners and
other persons, which is not contrary to any provision or requirement of
this chapter and, without limitation may:

(i)  Provide for classes, groups or series of trustees or beneficial
owners, or classes, groups or series of beneficial interests, having the
relative rights, powers and duties as the governing instrument may
provide, and may make provision for the future creation in the manner

rights, powers and duties senior or subordinate to existing classes,
groups or series of trustees, beneficial owners or beneficial interests;

purpose or investment objective;

(iii)  Provide for the taking of any action, including the amendment of
the governing instrument, the accomplishment of a merger or
consolidation, the appointment of one (1) or more trustees, the sale,
lease, exchange, transfer, pledge or other disposition of all or any
part of the assets of the statutory trust or the assets of any series,
or the dissolution of the statutory trust, or may provide for the taking
of any action to create under the provisions of the governing instrument
a class, group or series of beneficial interests that was not previously
outstanding, in any such case without the vote of or approval of any
particular trustee or beneficial owner, or class, group or series of
trustees or beneficial owners;

(iv)  Grant to, or withhold from, all or certain trustees or beneficial
owners, or a specified class, group or series of trustees or beneficial

thereof, into beneficial interests in the separate statutory trust, or
series thereof.

including fiduciary duties, and liabilities relating to a statutory

be either a signed or conformed copy, of the certificate of trust and
any certificates of amendment or cancellation or any certificate of

conform to law, upon receipt of all filing fees required he shall:

(i)  Certify that the certificate of trust, the certificate of
amendment, the certificate of cancellation or the certificate of merger

revoke the certificate of organization or for involuntary dissolution of
the statutory trust.

copying fees to recover costs to administer this chapter. Fees shall not

17‑23‑118.  Effective time and date of document.

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a document

trust name by delivering an application to the secretary of state for

secretary shall file the application and reserve the name for the
applicant's exclusive use for a nonrenewable one hundred twenty (120)
day period.

of the transferee.

17‑23‑120.  Derivative actions.

(a)  A beneficial owner may bring an action in the district court in the
right of a statutory trust to recover a judgment in its favor if
trustees with authority to do so have refused to bring the action or if
an effort to cause those trustees to bring the action is not likely to
succeed.

(b)  In a derivative action, the plaintiff must be a beneficial owner at
the time of bringing the action and:

(i)  At the time of the transaction of which he complains; or

(ii)  His status as a beneficial owner had devolved upon him by
operation of law or pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument of
the statutory trust from a person who was a beneficial owner at the time
of the transaction.

(c)  In a derivative action, the complaint shall set forth with
particularity the effort, if any, of the plaintiff to secure initiation
of the action by the trustees, or the reasons for not making the effort.

(d)  If a derivative action is successful, in whole or in part, or if
anything is received by a statutory trust as a result of a judgment,
compromise or settlement of any derivative action, the court may award
the plaintiff reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees.
If anything is so received by the plaintiff, the court shall make the
award of the plaintiff's expenses payable out of those proceeds and
direct the plaintiff to remit to the statutory trust the remainder of
the proceeds. If those proceeds are insufficient to reimburse the
plaintiff's reasonable expenses, the court may direct that any award of
plaintiff's expenses or portion thereof be paid by the statutory trust.

(e)  A beneficial owner's right to bring a derivative action may be
subject to additional standards and restrictions, if any, as are set
forth in the governing instrument, including, without limitation, the

instrument shall not be construed to deprive any trustee or beneficial
owner or other person of any right to indemnity which is otherwise
available to the person under the laws of this state.

ARTICLE 2

MERGER, CONSOLIDATION AND CONTINUANCE

17‑23‑201.  Merger and consolidation.

(a)  Pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, a statutory
trust may merge or consolidate with or into one (1) or more statutory
trusts or other business entities formed or organized or existing under
the laws of this state or any other state of the United States or any
foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction, with the statutory trust
or other business entity as the agreement provides being the surviving
or resulting statutory trust or other business entity. Unless otherwise
provided in the governing instrument of a statutory trust, a merger or
consolidation shall be approved by all of the trustees and the
beneficial owners of each statutory trust which is to merge or
consolidate. In connection with a merger or consolidation, rights or
securities of, or interests in, a statutory trust or other business
entity which is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may
be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities
of, or interests in, the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other
business entity or, in addition to or in lieu thereof, may be exchanged
for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or
interests in, a statutory trust or other business entity which is not
the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other business entity in
the merger or consolidation. Notwithstanding prior approval, an
agreement of merger or consolidation may be terminated or amended
pursuant to a provision for termination or amendment contained in the
agreement of merger or consolidation.

(b)  If a statutory trust is merging or consolidating under this
section, the statutory trust or other business entity surviving or
resulting from the merger or consolidation shall file a certificate of
merger or consolidation in the office of the secretary of state. The
certificate of merger or consolidation shall state:

(i)  The name and jurisdiction of formation or organization of each
statutory trust or other business entity which is to merge or
consolidate;

(ii)  That an agreement of merger or consolidation has been approved and
executed by each statutory trust or other business entity which is to
merge or consolidate;

(iii)  The name of the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other
business entity;

(iv)  The future effective date or time of the merger or consolidation
if it is not to be effective upon the filing of the certificate of
merger or consolidation;

(v)  That the executed agreement of merger or consolidation is on file
at the principal place of business of the surviving or resulting
statutory trust or other business entity, and the address thereof;

(vi)  That a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation will be
furnished by the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other
business entity, on request and without cost, to any beneficial owner of
any statutory trust or any person holding an interest in any other
business entity which is to merge or consolidate; and

(vii)  If the surviving or resulting entity is not a statutory trust or
other business entity formed or organized or existing under the laws of
this state, a statement that the surviving or resulting other business
entity agrees that it may be served with process in this state in any
action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any obligation of any
statutory trust which is to merge or consolidate. The statement shall
irrevocably appoint the secretary of state as the agent to accept
service of process in any such action, suit or proceeding and specify
the address to which a copy of the process shall be mailed by the
secretary of state. In the event of service under this paragraph upon
the secretary of state, the plaintiff shall furnish the secretary of
state with the address specified in the certificate of merger or
consolidation provided for in this paragraph and any other address which
the plaintiff may elect to furnish, together with copies of the process
required by the secretary of state. The secretary of state shall notify
the surviving or resulting other business entity at all addresses
furnished by the plaintiff by letter, certified mail, return receipt
requested. The letter shall enclose a copy of the process and any other
papers served upon the secretary of state. It shall be the duty of the
plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other
papers in duplicate, to notify the secretary of state that service is
being made pursuant to this paragraph, and to pay the secretary of state
the sum of fifty dollars (\$50.00) for use of the state, which shall be
taxed as part of the costs in the proceeding, if the plaintiff shall
prevail. The secretary of state shall maintain an alphabetical record of
any process under this paragraph setting forth the name of the plaintiff
and defendant, the title, docket number and nature of the proceedings in
which process has been served upon him, the return date thereof, and the
day and hour when the service was made. The secretary of state shall not
be required to retain the information for a period longer than five (5)
years from his receipt of the service of process.

(c)  Unless a future effective date or time is provided in a certificate
of merger or consolidation, in which event a merger or consolidation
shall be effective at the future effective date or time, a merger or
consolidation shall be effective upon the filing in the office of the
secretary of state of a certificate of merger or consolidation.

(d)  A certificate of merger or consolidation shall act as a certificate
of cancellation for a statutory trust which is not the surviving or
resulting entity in the merger or consolidation.

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the governing
instrument, a governing instrument containing a specific reference to
this subsection may provide that an agreement of merger or consolidation
approved in accordance with subsection (a) of this section may:

(i)  Effect any amendment to the governing instrument of the statutory
trust; or

(ii)  Effect the adoption of a new governing instrument of the statutory
trust if it is the surviving or resulting statutory trust in the merger
or consolidation.

(f)  Any amendment to the governing instrument of a statutory trust or
adoption of a new governing instrument of the statutory trust made
pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be effective at the
effective time or date of the merger or consolidation. The provisions of
subsection (e) of this section and this subsection shall not be
construed to limit the accomplishment of a merger or consolidation or of
any of the matters referred to in this article by any other means
provided for in the governing instrument of a statutory trust or other
agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, including that the governing
instrument of any constituent statutory trust to the merger or
consolidation, including a statutory trust formed for the purpose of
consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the governing
instrument of the surviving or resulting statutory trust.

(g)  When any merger or consolidation shall have become effective under
this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state, all of the
rights, privileges and powers of each of the statutory trusts and other
business entities that have merged or consolidated, and all property,
real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of those statutory
trusts and other business entities, as well as all other things and
causes of action belonging to each of such statutory trusts and other
business entities, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting
statutory trust or other business entity as they were of each of the
statutory trusts and other business entities that have merged or
consolidated. The title to any real property vested by deed or
otherwise, under the laws of the state, in any of merging or
consolidating statutory trusts and other business entities, shall not
revert or be in any way impaired by reason of this chapter. All rights
of creditors and all liens upon any property of any merging or
consolidating statutory trusts and other business entities shall be
preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of
the statutory trusts and other business entities that have merged or
consolidated shall attach to the surviving or resulting statutory trust
or other business entity, and may be enforced against it to the same
extent as if the debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or
contracted by it.

17‑23‑202.  Continuance of foreign statutory trusts.

(a)  Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any statutory trust
created for any purpose except acting as an insurer as defined in W.S.
26‑1‑102(a)(xvi), or acting as a financial institution as defined by
W.S. 13‑1‑101(a)(ix) or its successor statute, under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than this state may, if the jurisdiction will
acknowledge the statutory trust's termination of domicile in the foreign
jurisdiction, apply to the secretary of state for registration under
this chapter, thus continuing the statutory trust in Wyoming as if it
had been organized under the laws of this state. The secretary of state
may issue a certificate of continuance upon receipt of an application
for continuance as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The
certificate of continuance may then be issued subject to any limitations
and conditions and may contain any provisions as appear proper to the
secretary of state.

(b)  The secretary of state shall cause notice of issuance of a
certificate of continuance to be given forthwith to the proper officer
of the jurisdiction in which the statutory trust was previously
organized.

(c)  The application for continuance filed by a foreign statutory trust
with the secretary of state shall include:

(i)  A certified copy of its original certificate of trust and all
amendments thereto or its equivalent;

(ii)  The name of the statutory trust and the jurisdiction under the
laws of which it is organized;

(iii)  The date of organization and the period of duration of the
statutory trust;

(iv)  The address of the principal office of the statutory trust;

(v)  The street address of the proposed registered office of the
statutory trust in this state and the name of its proposed registered
agent in this state at the address;

(vi)  The purpose or purposes of the statutory trust which it proposes
to pursue in the transaction of business in this state;

(vii)  Any information concerning capital structure or financial status
the secretary of state deems necessary to establish fees and taxes under
the laws of this state;

(viii)  Any additional information necessary or appropriate to enable
the secretary of state to determine whether the statutory trust is
entitled to a certificate of organization evidencing its existence and
authority to transact business in this state.

(d)  The application shall be executed by the statutory trust by its
trustees or a trustee who is authorized to execute the application on
behalf of the statutory trust and shall be verified by the trustee
signing the application.

(e)  The provisions of the application for continuance may without
expressly so stating, vary from the provisions of the statutory trust's
certificate of trust or governing instrument or equivalent, if the
variation is one which a statutory trust organized under the Wyoming
Statutory Trust Act could effect by way of amendment to its certificate
of trust or governing instrument. Upon issuance of a certificate of
continuance by the secretary of state, the certificate of continuance
shall be the certificate of trust of the continued statutory trust. The
statutory trust may elect to incorporate by reference in and attachment
to the application for continuance its original certificate of trust or
other authorization which had been adopted by the statutory trust in the
foreign jurisdiction, in order to permit the original to continue to act
as the certificate of trust of the statutory trust provided, however,
that the original certificate of trust or other authorization shall be
deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it conform to the laws of
this state.

(f)  The existence of any statutory trust issued a certificate of
continuance under this chapter shall be deemed to have commenced on the
date the statutory trust commenced its existence in the jurisdiction in
which the statutory trust was first formed, organized or otherwise came
into being. The laws of this state shall apply to a statutory trust
continuing under this chapter to the same extent as if the statutory
trust had been organized under the laws of this state from and after the
issuance of a certificate of continuance under this chapter by the
secretary of state to the statutory trust. When a foreign statutory
trust is continued as a statutory trust under this chapter, the
continuance shall not affect the statutory trust's ownership of its
property or liability for any existing obligations, causes of action,
claims, pending or threatened prosecutions or civil or administrative
actions, convictions, rulings, orders, judgments or any other
characteristics or aspects of the statutory trust and its existence.

(g)  As used in this section, the term "statutory trust" shall include
any business trust, association or similar entity which appears to the
secretary of state to possess characteristics sufficiently similar to
those of a statutory trust organized under the Wyoming Statutory Trust
Act.

17‑29‑301.  No agency power of member as member.

(a)  A member is not an agent of a limited liability company solely by
reason of being a member.

for filing a statement of authority. The statement:

a limited liability company to persons that are not members.

(d)  Subject to subsection (c) of this section and W.S. 17‑29‑103(d) and
except as otherwise provided in subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this
section, a limitation on the authority of a person or a position
contained in an effective statement of authority is not by itself
evidence of knowledge or notice of the limitation by any person.

(e)  Subject to subsection (c) of this section, a grant of authority not
pertaining to transfers of real property and contained in an effective
statement of authority is conclusive in favor of a person that gives
value in reliance on the grant, except to the extent that when the
person gives value:

(i)  The person has knowledge to the contrary;

(ii)  The statement has been cancelled or restrictively amended under
subsection (b) of this section; or

(iii)  A limitation on the grant is contained in another statement of
authority that became effective after the statement containing the grant
became effective.

(f)  Subject to subsection (c) of this section, an effective statement
of authority that grants authority to transfer real property held in the
name of the limited liability company and that is recorded by certified
copy in the office for recording transfers of the real property is
conclusive in favor of a person that gives value in reliance on the
grant without knowledge to the contrary, except to the extent that when
the person gives value:

subsection (b) of this section and a certified copy of the cancellation
or restrictive amendment has been recorded in the office for recording
transfers of the real property; or

authority that became effective after the statement containing the grant
became effective and a certified copy of the later effective statement
is recorded in the office for recording transfers of the real property.

(g)  Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if a certified copy of

transfer real property held in the name of a limited liability company
is recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property,
all persons are deemed to know of the limitation.

(h)  Subject to subsection (j) of this section, an effective statement
of dissolution or termination is a cancellation of any filed statement
of authority for the purposes of subsection (f) of this section and is a
limitation on authority for the purposes of subsection (g) of this
section.

(j)  After a statement of dissolution becomes effective, a limited
liability company may deliver to the secretary of state for filing and,
if appropriate, may record a statement of authority that is designated
as a post dissolution statement of authority. The statement operates as
provided in subsections (f) and (g) of this section.

(k)  Unless earlier cancelled, an effective statement of authority is
cancelled by operation of law five (5) years after the date on which the
statement, or its most recent amendment, becomes effective. This

between them.

operation of a limited liability company, whether a single or multiple

ARTICLE 4

RELATIONS OF MEMBERS TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY

17‑29‑401.  Becoming a member.

(a)  If a limited liability company is to have only one (1) member upon
formation, the person becomes a member as determined by that person and
the organizer of the company. That person and the organizer may be, but
need not be, different persons. If different, the organizer acts on
behalf of the initial member.

(b)  If a limited liability company is to have more than one (1) member
upon formation, those persons become members as agreed by them. The
organizer acts on behalf of the persons in forming the company and may
be, but need not be, one of the persons.

(c)  Reserved.

(d)  After formation of a limited liability company, a person becomes a
member:

(i)  As provided in the operating agreement;

(ii)  As the result of a transaction effective under article 10 of this
chapter;

(iii)  With the consent of all the members; or

(vi)  If, within ninety (90) consecutive days after the company ceases
to have any members:

(A)  The last person to have been a member, or the legal representative
of that person, designates a person to become a member; and

(B)  The designated person consents to become a member.

(e)  A person may become a member without acquiring a transferable
interest and without making or being obligated to make a contribution to
the limited liability company.

17‑29‑402.  Form of contribution.

A contribution may consist of tangible or intangible property or other
benefit to a limited liability company, including money, services
performed, promissory notes, other agreements to contribute money or
property and contracts for services to be performed.

17‑29‑403.  Liability for contributions.

A person's obligation to make a contribution to a limited liability
company is not excused by the person's death, disability or other
inability to perform personally. If a person does not make a required
contribution, the person or the person's estate is obligated to
contribute money equal to the value of the part of the contribution
which has not been made, at the option of the company.

17‑29‑404.  Sharing of and right to distributions before dissolution.

(a)  Any distributions made by a limited liability company before its
dissolution and winding up shall be in equal shares among members and
dissociated members, except:

(i)  To the extent otherwise provided in a written or verbal operating
agreement as set forth in W.S. 17‑29‑110;

(ii)  To the extent necessary to comply with any transfer effective
under W.S. 17‑29‑502 and any charging order in effect under W.S.
17‑29‑503; or

(iii)  To the extent otherwise represented by the company through an
authorized representative in tax filings with the Internal Revenue
Service in which the status elected by the company is not timely
disputed by any member.

(b)  A person has a right to a distribution before the dissolution and
winding up of a limited liability company only if the company decides to
make an interim distribution. A person's dissociation does not entitle
the person to a distribution.

(c)  A person does not have a right to demand or receive a distribution
from a limited liability company in any form other than money. Except as
otherwise provided in W.S. 17‑29‑708(c), a limited liability company may
distribute an asset in kind if each part of the asset is fungible with
each other part and each person receives a percentage of the asset equal
in value to the person's share of distributions.

(d)  If a member or transferee becomes entitled to receive a
distribution, the member or transferee has the status of, and is
entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited
liability company with respect to the distribution.

17‑29‑405.  Limitations on distribution.

(a)  A limited liability company shall not make a distribution if after
the distribution:

(i)  The company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due
in the ordinary course of the company's activities; or

(ii)  The company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total
liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to
be dissolved, wound up and terminated at the time of the distribution,
to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up and
termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those
of persons receiving the distribution.

(b)  A limited liability company may base a determination that a
distribution is not prohibited under subsection (a) of this section on
financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and
principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair
valuation or other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.

(c)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, the
effect of a distribution under subsection (a) of this section is
measured:

(i)  In the case of a distribution by purchase, redemption or other
acquisition of a transferable interest in the company, as of the date
money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the company;
and

(ii)  In all other cases, as of the date:

(A)  The distribution is authorized, if the payment occurs within one
hundred twenty (120) days after that date; or

(B)  The payment is made, if the payment occurs more than one hundred
twenty (120) days after the distribution is authorized.

(d)  Except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing, a limited
liability company's indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a
distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the
company's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors.

(e)  A limited liability company's indebtedness, including indebtedness
issued in connection with or as part of a distribution, is not a
liability for purposes of subsection (a) of this section if the terms of
the indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest are made
only to the extent that a distribution could be made to members under
this section.

(f)  If indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of
principal or interest on the indebtedness is treated as a distribution,
the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made.

(g)  In subsection (a) of this section, "distribution" does not include
amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past
services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of business
under a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits program.

17‑29‑406.  Liability for improper distributions.

(a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, if
a member of a member-managed limited liability company or manager of a
manager-managed limited liability company consents to a distribution
made in violation of W.S. 17‑29‑405 and in consenting to the
distribution fails to comply with W.S. 17‑29‑409, the member or manager
is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution
that exceeds the amount that could have been distributed without the
violation of W.S. 17‑29‑405.

(b)  To the extent the operating agreement of a member-managed limited
liability company expressly relieves a member of the authority and
responsibility to consent to distributions and imposes that authority
and responsibility on one (1) or more other members, the liability
stated in subsection (a) of this section applies to the other members
and not the member that the operating agreement relieves of authority
and responsibility.

(c)  A person that receives a distribution knowing that the distribution
to that person was made in violation of W.S. 17‑29‑405 is personally
liable to the limited liability company but only to the extent that the
distribution received by the person exceeded the amount that could have
been properly paid under W.S. 17‑29‑405.

(d)  A person against which an action is commenced because the person is
liable under subsection (a) of this section may:

(i)  Implead any other person that is subject to liability under
subsection (a) of this section and seek to compel contribution from the
person; and

(ii)  Implead any person that received a distribution in violation of
subsection (c) of this section and seek to compel contribution from the
person in the amount the person received in violation of subsection (c)
of this section.

(e)  An action under this section is barred if not commenced within two
(2) years after the distribution.

17‑29‑407.  Management of limited liability company.

(a)  A limited liability company is a member-managed limited liability
company unless the articles of organization or the operating agreement:

(i)  Expressly provides that:

(A)  The company is or will be "manager-managed";

(B)  The company is or will be "managed by managers"; or

(C)  Management of the company is or will be "vested in managers"; or

(ii)  Includes words of similar import.

(b)  In a member-managed limited liability company, unless the articles
of organization or the operating agreement provide otherwise, the
following rules apply:

(i)  The management and conduct of the company are vested in the
members;

(ii)  Each member has equal rights in the management and conduct of the
company's activities except:

(A)  That a member's interest is otherwise defined in W.S.
17‑29‑102(a)(xxiv);

(B)  To the extent otherwise provided in any other provision in this
chapter; or

(C)  To the extent otherwise represented by the company through an
authorized representative in tax filings with the Internal Revenue
Service in which the status elected by the company is not timely
disputed by any member.

(iii)  A difference arising among members as to a matter in the ordinary
course of the activities of the company may be decided by a majority of
the members;

(iv)  An act outside the ordinary course of the activities of the
company may be undertaken only with the consent of all members;

(v)  The operating agreement may be amended only with the consent of all
members.

(c)  In a manager-managed limited liability company, unless the articles
of organization or the operating agreement provide otherwise, the
following rules apply:

(i)  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, any matter
relating to the activities of the company is decided exclusively by the
managers;

(ii)  Each manager has equal rights in the management and conduct of the
activities of the company;

(iii)  A difference arising among managers as to a matter in the
ordinary course of the activities of the company may be decided by a
majority of the managers;

(iv)  The consent of all members is required to:

(A)  Sell, lease, exchange or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially
all, of the company's property, with or without the good will, outside
the ordinary course of the company's activities;

(B)  Approve a merger, conversion, continuance, transfer or
domestication under article 10 of this chapter;

(C)  Undertake any other act outside the ordinary course of the
company's activities; and

(D)  Amend the operating agreement.

(v)  A manager may be chosen at any time by the consent of a majority of
the members and remains a manager until a successor has been chosen,
unless the manager at an earlier time resigns, is removed or dies, or,
in the case of a manager that is not an individual, terminates. A
manager may be removed at any time by the consent of a majority of the
members without notice or cause;

(vi)  A person need not be a member to be a manager, but the
dissociation of a member that is also a manager removes the person as a
manager. If a person that is both a manager and a member ceases to be a
manager, that cessation does not by itself dissociate the person as a
member;

(vii)  A person's ceasing to be a manager does not discharge any debt,
obligation or other liability to the limited liability company or
members which the person incurred while a manager.

(d)  An action requiring the consent of members under this article may
be taken without a meeting, and a member may appoint a proxy or other
agent to consent or otherwise act for the member by signing an
appointing record, personally or by the member's agent.

(e)  The dissolution of a limited liability company does not affect the
applicability of this section. However, a person that wrongfully causes
dissolution of the company loses the right to participate in management
as a member and a manager.

(f)  This article does not entitle a member to remuneration for services
performed for a member-managed limited liability company, except for
reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the
activities of the company.

17‑29‑408.  Indemnification and insurance.

(a)  A limited liability company shall reimburse for any payment made
and indemnify for any debt, obligation or other liability incurred by a
member of a member-managed company or the manager of a manager-managed
company in the course of the member's or manager's activities on behalf
of the company, if, in making the payment or incurring the debt,
obligation or other liability, the member or manager complied with the
duties stated in W.S. 17‑29‑405 and 17‑29‑409.

(b)  A limited liability company may purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of a member or manager of the company against liability asserted
against or incurred by the member or manager in that capacity or arising
from that status.

17‑29‑409.  Standards of conduct for members and managers.

(a)  A member of a member-managed limited liability company owes to the
company and, subject to W.S. 17‑29‑901(b), the other members the
fiduciary duties of loyalty and care stated in subsections (b) and (c).

(b)  The duty of loyalty of a member in a member-managed limited
liability company includes the duties:

(i)  To account to the company and to hold as trustee for it any
property, profit or benefit derived by the member:

(A)  In the conduct or winding up of the company's activities;

(B)  From a use by the member of the company's property; or

up of the company's activities as or on behalf of a person having an
interest adverse to the company; and

(iii)  To refrain from competing with the company in the conduct of the
company's activities before the dissolution of the company.

(c)  Subject to the business judgment rule, the duty of care of a member
of a member-managed limited liability company in the conduct and winding
up of the company's activities is to act with the care that a person in
a like position would reasonably exercise under similar circumstances
and in a manner the member reasonably believes to be in the best
interests or at least not opposed to the best interests of the company.
In discharging this duty, a member may rely in good faith upon opinions,
reports, statements or other information provided by another person that
the member reasonably believes is a competent and reliable source for
the information.

(d)  A member in a member-managed limited liability company or a
manager-managed limited liability company shall discharge the duties
under this chapter or under the operating agreement and exercise any
rights consistently with the contractual obligation of good faith and
fair dealing.

(e)  It is a defense to a claim under paragraph (b)(ii) of this section
and any comparable claim in equity or at common law that the transaction
was fair to or at least not opposed to the limited liability company.

(f)  All of the members of a member-managed limited liability company or
a manager-managed limited liability company may authorize or ratify,
after full disclosure of all material facts, a specific act or
transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty.

(g)  In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following rules
apply:

(i)  Subsections (a), (b), (c) and (e) of this section apply to the
manager or managers and not the members;

(ii)  The duty stated under paragraph (b)(iii) of this section continues
until winding up is completed;

(iii)  Subsection (d) of this section applies to the members and
managers;

(iv)  Subsection (f) of this section applies only to the members;

apply:

(i)  On reasonable notice, a member may inspect and copy during regular
business hours, at a reasonable location specified by the company, any
record maintained by the company regarding the company's activities,
financial condition and other circumstances, to the extent the
information is material to the member's rights and duties under the
operating agreement or this chapter;

(ii)  The company shall furnish to each member:

(A)  On demand, any information concerning the company's activities,
financial condition and other circumstances which the company knows and
is material to the proper exercise of the member's rights and duties
under the operating agreement or this chapter, except to the extent the
company can establish that it reasonably believes the member already
knows the information; and

(B)  On demand, any other information concerning the company's
activities, financial condition and other circumstances, except to the
extent the demand or information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise
improper under the circumstances.

subsection also applies to each member to the extent the member knows

and the duty stated in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section apply to the

specified by the company, a member may obtain from the company and

condition and other circumstances of the company as is just and
reasonable if:

member's interest as a member;

(B)  The member makes a demand in a record received by the company,
describing with reasonable particularity the information sought and the
purpose for seeking the information; and

(C)  The information sought is directly connected to the member's
purpose.

(iii)  Within ten (10) days after receiving a demand pursuant to
subparagraph (ii)(B) of this subsection, the company shall in a record

(A)  Of the information that the company will provide in response to the
demand and when and where the company will provide the information; and

(B)  If the company declines to provide any demanded information, the
company's reasons for declining.

(iv)  Whenever this chapter or an operating agreement provides for a
member to give or withhold consent to a matter, before the consent is
given or withheld, the company shall, upon demand, provide the member
with all information that is known to the company and is material to the
member's decision.

(c)  On ten (10) days' demand made in a record received by a limited
liability company, a dissociated member may have access to information
to which the person was entitled while a member if the information
pertains to the period during which the person was a member, the person
seeks the information in good faith and the person satisfies the
requirements imposed on a member by paragraph (b)(ii) of this section.
The company shall respond to a demand made pursuant to this subsection
in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(iii) of this section.

(d)  A limited liability company may charge a person that makes a demand
under this section the reasonable costs of copying, limited to the costs
of labor and material.

(e)  A member or dissociated member may exercise rights under this
section through an agent or, in the case of an individual under legal
disability, a legal representative. Any restriction or condition imposed
by the operating agreement or under subsection (g) of this section
applies both to the agent or legal representative and the member or
dissociated member.

(f)  The rights under this section do not extend to a person as
transferee.

(g)  In addition to any restriction or condition stated in its operating
agreement, a limited liability company, as a matter within the ordinary
course of its activities, may impose reasonable restrictions and
conditions on access to and use of information to be furnished under
this section, including designating information confidential and
imposing nondisclosure and safeguarding obligations on the recipient. In
a dispute concerning the reasonableness of a restriction under this
subsection, the company has the burden of proving reasonableness.

AND CREDITORS

17‑29‑501.  Nature of transferable interest.

17‑29‑502.  Transfer of transferable interest.

(a)  A transfer, in whole or in part, of a transferable interest:

(i)  Is permissible;

(ii)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, does not by itself
cause a member's dissociation or a dissolution and winding up of the
limited liability company's activities; and

(iii)  Subject to W.S. 17‑29‑504, does not entitle the transferee to:

(A)  Participate in the management or conduct of the company's
activities; or

(B)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section,
have access to records or other information concerning the company's
activities.

(b)  A transferee has the right to receive, in accordance with the
transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be
entitled.

(c)  In a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company, a
transferee is entitled to an account of the company's transactions only
from the date of dissolution.

(d)  A transferable interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the
interest issued by the limited liability company in a record, and,
subject to this section, the interest represented by the certificate may
be transferred by a transfer of the certificate.

(e)  A limited liability company need not give effect to a transferee's
rights under this section until the company has notice of the transfer.

(f)  A transfer of a transferable interest in violation of a restriction
on transfer contained in the operating agreement is ineffective as to a
person having notice of the restriction at the time of transfer.

(g)  Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 17‑29‑602(a)(iv)(B), when a
member transfers a transferable interest, the transferor retains the
rights of a member other than the interest in distributions transferred
and retains all duties and obligations of a member.

(h)  When a member transfers a transferable interest to a person that
becomes a member with respect to the transferred interest, the
transferee is liable for the member's obligations under W.S. 17‑29‑403
and 17‑29‑406(c) known to the transferee when the transferee becomes a
member.

17‑29‑503.  Charging order.

(a)  On application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a
court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of
the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A
charging order requires the limited liability company to pay over to the
person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that
would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.

(b)  Reserved.

(c)  Reserved.

(d)  The member or transferee whose transferable interest is subject to
a charging order under subsection (a) of this section may extinguish the
charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of
the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order.

(e)  A limited liability company or one (1) or more members whose
transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to
the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby
succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging
order.

(f)  This article does not deprive any member or transferee of the
benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the member's or transferee's
transferable interest.

(g)  This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a person
seeking to enforce a judgment against a judgment debtor, including any
judgment debtor who may be the sole member, dissociated member or
transferee, may, in the capacity of the judgment creditor, satisfy the
judgment from the judgment debtor's transferable interest or from the
assets of the limited liability company. Other remedies, including
foreclosure on the judgment debtor's limited liability interest and a
court order for directions, accounts and inquiries that the judgment
debtor might have made are not available to the judgment creditor
attempting to satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's interest
in the limited liability company and may not be ordered by the court.

17‑29‑504.  Power of personal representative of deceased member.

If a member dies, the deceased member's personal representative or other
legal representative may exercise the rights of a transferee provided in
W.S. 17‑29‑502(c) and, for the purposes of settling the estate, the
rights of a current member under W.S. 17‑29‑410.

members for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in
addition to any other debt, obligation or other liability of the member
to the company or the other members.

17‑29‑602.  Events causing dissociation.

(a)  A person is dissociated as a member from a limited liability

limited liability company may at any time within two (2) years after the
forfeiture of its articles of organization of certificate of authority,
be revived and reinstated by paying the amount of the delinquent fees.

as of the effective date deemed defunct pursuant to this subsection and

had never been deemed defunct.

state, and the forfeiture shall be made effective in the manner provided

meet the definition to file an amendment to its articles of organization
with the secretary of state amending its name to conform with the
requirements of W.S. 17‑29‑108, it shall be deemed to be transacting
business in this state without authority and to have forfeited any
franchises, rights or privileges acquired under the laws thereof and the
forfeiture shall be made effective in the same manner as provided in
subsection (a) of this section. The reinstatement provisions and fees
provided in subsection (a) of this section shall apply.

relationship.

and prove an actual or threatened injury that is not solely the result
of an injury suffered or threatened to be suffered by the limited
liability company.

17‑29‑902.  Derivative action.

limited liability company if:

(i)  The member first makes a demand on the other members in a
member-managed limited liability company, or the managers of a
manager-managed limited liability company, requesting that they cause
the company to bring an action to enforce the right, and the managers or
other members do not bring the action within a reasonable time; or

(ii)  A demand under paragraph (i) of this subsection would be futile.

17‑29‑903.  Proper plaintiff.

(a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, a
derivative action under W.S. 17‑29‑902 may be maintained only by a

company. If the company appoints a special litigation committee, on
motion by the committee made in the name of the company, except for good
cause shown, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably
necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation. This
subsection does not prevent the court from enforcing a person's right to
information under W.S. 17‑29‑410 or, for good cause shown, granting
extraordinary relief in the form of a temporary restraining order or
preliminary injunction.

(b)  A special litigation committee may be composed of one (1) or more
disinterested and independent individuals, who may be members.

(c)  A special litigation committee may be appointed:

(i)  In a member-managed limited liability company:

(A)  By the consent of a majority of the members not named as defendants
or plaintiffs in the proceeding; and

proceeding, by a majority of the members named as defendants; or

(iv)  Be dismissed.

(e)  After making a determination under subsection (d) of this section,
a special litigation committee shall file with the court a statement of
its determination and its report supporting its determination, giving
notice to the plaintiff. The court shall determine whether the members
of the committee were disinterested and independent and whether the
committee conducted its investigation and made its recommendation in
good faith, independently and with reasonable care, with the committee
having the burden of proof. If the court finds that the members of the
committee were disinterested and independent and that the committee
acted in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, the court
shall enforce the determination of the committee. Otherwise, the court
shall dissolve the stay of discovery entered under subsection (a) of
this section and allow the action to proceed under the direction of the
plaintiff.

(b)  A converted organization that is a foreign organization consents to
the jurisdiction of the courts of this state to enforce any debt,
obligation or other liability for which the converting limited liability
company is liable. A converted organization that is a foreign

appoints the secretary of state as its agent for service of process for
purposes of enforcing a debt, obligation or other liability under this
subsection.

17‑29‑1010.  Continuance.

(a)  Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any organization
organized for any purpose except acting as an insurer as defined in W.S.
26‑1‑102(a)(xvi), or acting as a financial institution under the laws of
any foreign jurisdiction may, if the foreign jurisdiction will
acknowledge that the organization's domicile has terminated in the
foreign jurisdiction, apply to the secretary of state for registration
under this act. The secretary of state may issue a certificate of
registration upon receipt of an application supported by articles of
continuance as provided by this act together with the statements,
information and documents set out in subsection (c) of this section. The
certificate of registration may then be issued continuing the
organization in Wyoming as if it had been organized as a limited
liability company in this state. The certificate of registration may be
subject to any limitations and conditions as may appear proper to the
secretary of state.

(b)  The secretary of state shall cause notice of issuance of a
certificate of registration to be given forthwith to the proper officer
of the foreign jurisdiction in which the organization was previously
organized.

(c)  The articles of continuance filed by a foreign organization with
the secretary of state shall contain:

(i)  A certified copy of its original articles of organization and all
amendments thereto or its equivalent basic charter;

(ii)  The names of the organization and the foreign jurisdiction in
which it has previously been lawfully organized;

(iii)  The date of organization;

(iv)  The address of its principal mailing address;

(ix)  Repealed By Laws 2014, Ch. 65, § 2.

(x)  Any additional information permitted in articles of organization
under W.S. W.S. 17‑29‑201.

(d)  The application shall be executed by the manager or managers if any
or by any member who is authorized to execute the application on behalf
of the organization.

(e)  The provisions of the articles of continuance may, without
expressly so stating, vary from the provisions of the organization's
articles of organization or equivalent basic charter or other
authorization, if the variation is one which a company organized under
the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act could effect by way of
amendment to its articles of organization. Upon issuance of a
certificate of continuance by the secretary of state, the articles of
continuance shall be deemed to be the articles of organization of the
continued organization. The organization may elect to incorporate by
reference in the articles of continuance its basic charter or other
authorization which has been adopted by it in the foreign jurisdiction,
in order to permit the same to continue to act as the articles of
organization, provided, however, that the basic charter or other
authorization shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make
the same conform to the laws of Wyoming and to the provisions of the
articles of continuance.

(f)  Except for the purpose of W.S. 16‑6‑101 through 16‑6‑118, the
existence of any organization heretofore or hereafter issued a
certificate of continuation under this act shall be deemed to have
commenced on the date the organization commenced its existence in the
jurisdiction in which it was first formed, organized or otherwise came
into being. The laws of Wyoming shall apply to an organization
continuing under this act to the same extent as if it had been organized
under the laws of Wyoming from and after the issuance of a certificate
of continuation under this act by the secretary of state. When a foreign
organization is continued under this act, the continuance shall not
affect the ownership of its property, or its liability for any existing
obligations, causes of action, claims, pending or threatened prosecution
or civil or administration actions, convictions, rulings, orders or
judgments.

(g)  Continuance under this act does not deprive a member of any right
or privilege that he claims under, or relieve any member of any
liability in respect of, his membership.

17‑29‑1011.  Transfer of a Wyoming limited liability company to another
jurisdiction.

(a)  A limited liability company created, domesticated or continued
under this chapter may, if authorized by resolution duly adopted as set
forth in subsection (f) of this section, and by the laws of any other

officer of the other jurisdiction for a certificate of registration, and

conditions he considers appropriate for the protection of creditors,
including the provision of notice to the public of the application
described in subsection (a) of this section, the provision of a bond or
a deposit of funds in an appropriate depository located in Wyoming and
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Wyoming, and if such
conditions are not met, the secretary of state may refuse to issue a

(c)  The secretary of state, upon compliance by the applicant and the
secretary with subsections (a) and (b) of this section and receipt of
payment of the special toll charge prescribed by subsection (e) of this
section shall immediately transmit a notice of issuance of a certificate
of transfer to the proper officer of the jurisdiction to which the
limited liability company is transferred.

(d)  Upon issuance of a certificate of transfer, the limited liability
company shall be continued as if it had been organized under the laws of
the other jurisdiction and becomes a limited liability company under the
laws of the other jurisdiction upon issuance by such jurisdiction of a
certificate of registration.

(e)  Every limited liability company organized, domesticated or
continued under the laws of this state in order to receive a certificate
of transfer pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall pay to the
secretary of state, in addition to all other statutory taxes and fees, a
special toll charge of fifty dollars (\$50.00).

jurisdiction shall be adopted by the members.

of the jurisdiction to which the limited liability company is
transferred that the laws of the state of Wyoming permit such transfer,
and may describe the permission extended by this section as authorizing
the domestication, continuance or other transfer of domicile as may be
required by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in order for the
limited liability company to be accepted in that jurisdiction, provided
that the limited liability company may not misrepresent the requirements
or effects of the provisions of this section.

17‑29‑1012.  Domestication of foreign limited liability companies.

Any limited liability company created under the laws of any of the
several states of the United States for any purpose except acting as an
insurer as defined in W.S. 26‑1‑102(a)(xvi), or acting as a financial
institution may become a domestic limited liability company of this
state by delivering or causing to be delivered to the secretary of state
articles of domestication. Upon filing the articles of domestication,
the secretary of state shall issue to the foreign limited liability
company a certificate of domestication which shall continue the company
as if it had been created under this chapter. The articles of
domestication, upon being filed by the secretary of state, constitute
the articles of the domesticated foreign limited liability company and
it shall thereafter have all the powers and privileges and be subjected
to all the duties and limitations granted and imposed upon domestic
limited liability companies under the provisions of the Revised Uniform
Limited Liability Company Act.

17‑29‑1013.  Application for certificate of domestication; articles of
